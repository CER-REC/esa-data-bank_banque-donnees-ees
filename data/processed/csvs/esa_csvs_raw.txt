Ensure landowner and\/or regulatory approvals are in place for all additional work areasprior to use.3.Access: Utilize shoo-flies in upland areas for access, where possible. Where shoo-flies in upland areas do not provide reasonableaccess, consider ramping options to support work side traffic and pipeline installation.4.Equipment: Use wide pad, low-ground-pressure equipment or have standard equipment work off mats (see Plan View) to install orcreate containment berms\/barriers. Avoid rutting and admixing of wetland with appropriate ramping options such as mats (timberor swamp mats) or geotextile and spoil ramps.5.Clearing\/Grading: Restrict vegetation removal only to that area necessary for pipeline construction. Utilize appropriate machinery(i.e., wide pad machines) and swamp mats or equivalent.6.Isolation:  If  deep  water  is  encountered,  salvaged  surface  material  and  trench  spoil  may  be  used  as  a  containment  berm\/barrier(see A above). Consider using spoil material from the trench line as a containment barrier where salvaged surface material is notable to support a berm\/barrier. Alternate dam devices such as an aquadam or meter bags are other options (see B above).

If  the  trench  requires  dewatering  prior  to  lowering-in,  pump  water  into  stable  andwell-vegetated areas. Monitor discharge areas and change discharge location if adequate natural filtration is no longer possibleand sedimentation occurs.8.Trench Plugs: Ensure trench does not provide drainage conduit into or out of wetland during or after construction. Install trenchplugs where warranted or monitor hard plugs.9.Trench  Breakers:  Install  trench  breakers,  where  warranted,  at  the  edge  of  wetlands  to  prevent  the  pipe  trench  from  acting  as  adrain and to prevent unconsolidated organic soils from sloughing into the channel.10. Buoyancy: If warranted, weight pipe as per engineering plans prior to installation.11. Backfill: Backfill and do not leave a trench crown during clean-up of mineral wetlands.

The SACC provides guidance for how climate change impacts are to be assessed for projects with a federal impact assessment under the Impact Assessment Act (ECCC 2020a). The SACC requires proponents of projects with a lifetime beyond 2050 to provide a credible plan that describes how the project will achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 (ECCC 2020a). The requirements outlined in the CER Filing Manual (CER 2020) for assessing GHG emissions from Project activities include consideration of the SACC guidance. Reducing emissions from methane (CH<s>4<\/s>) is a key part of Canada's strengthened climate plan and its commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, ensuring a healthy economy and a healthy environment for Canada. ECCC has also launched ClimateWest, a new nonprofit regional hub for climate services for the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta to provide tailored and easily accessible regional climate information, data, tools, and training to support several different areas, including agriculture industry, rural and Indigenous communities, businesses, and all levels of government to make better-informed decisions on how to plan and adapt to climate change (ECCC 2021d). The Government of Canada\u2019s ERF is a program intended to cut methane emissions significantly and as of early April 2021, 15 companies representing 40 projects across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have signed contribution agreements (Government of Canada 2021f). This includes the interprovincial project involving Manitoba's Tundra Oil & Gas Limited and Alberta's Steel Reef Pipelines Canada Corp. that will use ERF funding to eliminate a projected 1.5 megatonnes of GHG emissions. To support these efforts, Steel Reef will build essential infrastructure that safely transports the conserved natural gas to its processing facility in Saskatchewan. The emissions reduction funding granted to Steel Reef also supports the installation of infrastructure to eliminate CH<s>4<\/s> emissions from five upstream facilities in Saskatchewan. In addition to the effort discussed above, Steel Reef is currently developing a wide-ranging, credible, and attainable plan to reduce GHG emissions to net zero by the year 2050. The plan is intended to be finalized in 2022.""]]"

Consideration of the beneficial and adverse effects of a project include the nature and extent of effects, indicators or mechanisms that can be used to measure the extent of effects, interplay between obligations and commitments impacted by Project effects, links to other decision-making factors (e.g., sustainability), and local and regional context (Government of Canada 2020b).""],[""Provincial - Manitoba"","""",""""],[""Government of Manitoba"",""Ambient Air Quality Objectives for Manitoba"",""The Province of Manitoba\u2019s Air Quality Objectives and Guidelines (Manitoba Sustainable Development 2005) include three levels of criteria: the Maximum Tolerable Level, the Maximum Acceptable Level and the Maximum Desirable Level.

The Air Quality Compressor Station RSA is large enough such that the modelled effects of the Sinclair Compressor Station fall to less than 10% of applicable AAQO, while the maximum modelled effects are near or at the property line. The spatial boundary also encompasses the areas where there is a potential for cumulative environmental effects from other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable developments and activities. The Air Quality RSA boundaries were defined based on the knowledge and previous experience of qualified professionals.""],[""GHG Emissions"",""Beyond Air Quality RSA"",""Beyond Air Quality RSA: GHG emissions can have global effects and are managed at the provincial and national levels. Therefore, the spatial boundary for GHG emissions extends beyond the Air Quality RSA. This assessment follows common practice to compare Project-related GHG emissions to total annual provincial and national GHG emissions, since regulations and GHG emission reduction targets are set at the provincial and national levels.""]]"

For this assessment, communities in the RM of Pipestone No. 162 in Manitoba and RM of Antler No. 61 and RM of Storthoaks No. 31 in Saskatchewan were included."",""Community LSA: For inclusion of communities in the Community LSA, the primary criterion was whether direct effects, such as a physical, social, or economic change, could result from an interaction between components of the Project (i.e., pipeline construction right-of-way and compressor station construction footprint) and community residents, or economic, social, or cultural resources of interest. The secondary criterion for the inclusion in the Community LSA was whether the population centre offers good or services that may be used during Project activities, including communities where workers reside or use infrastructure and services. Community RSA: includes the regional boundaries in which Project components are located and communities and resources that are not included in the Community LSA but may be directly and indirectly affected by the Project.""]]"

While most Project effects are expected to be localized within the PCF, the Physical Environment and Soils LSA includes a 100 m ZOI, where effects may extend beyond the PCF. The ZOI is defined as the area likely to be affected by all phases of the Project, and incorporates the potential cumulative effects interactions that may extend beyond the PCF.  Erosion and sedimentation have the potential to impact areas beyond the ZOI; however due to gentle slopes along the PCF and utilizing a trenchless crossing technique at both watercourse locations, potential effects and cumulative effects interactions are not anticipated to extend beyond the Physical Environment and Soil Productivity LSA.
