Table 13G-4 Rank Definitions Used in British Columbia 
Rank Definition 

S1  Critically Imperiled—Critically imperiled because of extreme rarity or some factor that makes it 
especially vulnerable to extirpation.  Typically 5 or fewer occurrences or very few remaining 
individuals (<1,000). 

S2  Imperiled—Imperiled because of rarity or because of some factor that makes it very vulnerable 
to extirpation. Typically 6 to 20 occurrences or few remaining individuals (1,000 to 3,000). 

S3  Vulnerable—Vulnerable because it is rare and uncommon or it is found only in a restricted 
range (even if abundant at some locations), or because of other factor that makes it vulnerable 
to extirpation. Typically 21 to 100 occurrences or between 3,000 and 10,000 individuals. 

S4  Apparently Secure—Uncommon but not rare and usually widespread. Possibly a long-term 
concern. Usually more than 100 occurrences and more than 10,000 individuals. 

S5  Secure—Common, widespread, and abundant. Essentially ineradicable under present 
conditions. Typically with more than 100 occurrences and more than 10,000 individuals. 

S#S#  Range Rank—A numeric range rank (e.g., S2S3) indicates the range of uncertainty about the 
exact status of the element. Ranges cannot skip more than one rank.

Rank Definition 
Red 
list 

Includes indigenous species or subspecies that have, or are candidates for Extirpated, 
Endangered, or Threatened status in British Columbia. Extirpated taxa do not exist in 
the wild in British Columbia, but do occur elsewhere. Endangered taxa are facing 
imminent extirpation or extinction. Threatened taxa are likely to become endangered if 
limiting factors are not reversed. Not all Red-listed taxa will necessarily become formally 
designated. Placing taxa on these lists flags them as being at risk and requiring 
investigation. 

Blue 
list 

Includes any indigenous species or subspecies considered to be Vulnerable in British 
Columbia. Vulnerable taxa are of special concern because of characteristics that make 
them particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events. Blue-listed taxa are at 
risk, but are not Extirpated, Endangered or Threatened.
