13D.B.1 Introduction 

13D.B.1.1 Project Overview 

The Ekwan Pipeline Project (the project) will extend approximately 83 km from northeast 
BC, east into Alberta. The Project requires a total of eight watercourse crossings; all 
crossings will be constructed during frozen ground conditions. Of these crossings, the four 
named crossings are determined to have potential fisheries value and may be flowing 
during the construction period although these watercourses were all frozen to substrate 
during winter 2003 (refer to Figures 13D.B-1 to 13D.B-5 for a view of the named 
watercourse crossings).  

13D.B.1.2 Plan Objectives 

This Watercourse Crossing Report forms part of the Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) 
to be implemented during project construction and operation. The report is intended to 
provide a reference for Project Supervisors, Environmental Inspectors and Contractors, as 
well as regulatory and permitting agencies. Specifically, this report provides the following 
information: 

• site-specific descriptions and construction plans for major watercourse crossings 

• general approaches and mitigation measures to be implemented for Horizontal 
Direction Drills 

• general approaches and mitigation measures to be implemented for trenched 
crossings 

• general approaches and mitigation measures to be implemented for vehicle crossing 
structures 

13D.B.1.3 Proposed Site-Specific Pipeline and Vehicle Crossing Methods 

Table 13D.B-1 provides a summary of the proposed crossing procedures for the eight 
defined watercourses crossed by the proposed pipeline. In the following subsections, more 
details are provided for the four named crossings: Kyklo Creek, Townsoitoi Creek, Hay 
River and Little Hay River. 

13D.B.1.3.1 Kyklo Creek 

Kyklo Creek is a slow flowing, meandering watercourse with an active channel width of 17 
to 22 m in the vicinity of the crossing, and gently to moderately sloping banks that average 
less than 2 m in height. Approaches to the banks are gently sloping into aspen-dominated 
mixedwood forest on both sides of the creek. Its banks and substrates are predominantly 
fines (sand). This creek supports negligible to low flows (< 1 m3/sec) in the winter.

A horizontal directional drill is proposed for the crossing.  Drill entry and exit points will be 
located in flat, moderately drained, aspen dominated mixedwood stands, approximately 
149 m southeast and 134 m northwest of the channel (see Figure 13D.B-1). 

An eight m-wide access trail and associated ice bridge will run between the entry and exit 
points of the drill. The alignment of the access trail will fall slightly to the southwest of the 
drill path to take advantage of a narrowing of the channel and gently sloping approach 
slopes that will require limited grading (see Figure 13D.B-2). The ice bridge will be 
constructed of clean snow salvaged from surface of the frozen channel, using a wide pad, 
low ground pressure dozers, and frozen in with water applications.  If free water is available 
beneath the ice, the creek may be used as a source of water for the ice bridge.  If not, 
water will be trucked to the site. Bridge construction will be completed in 1 to 2 days. 

Restoration of the access trail within 20 m of the channel (i.e., approximate riparian zone) 
will involve the installation of one or two surface diversion berms across the access trail to 
prevent run-off from snowmelt or precipitation events from entering the creek.  Shrub 
plantings or bundles using local on-site shrub species will be incorporated into the berms to 
provide long term stability and cover. The ice bridge will be notched in one or two locations 
at the time of clean-up to prevent ice jams in the watercourse during break-up. 

13D.B.1.3.2 Townsoitoi Creek 

Townsoitoi Creek is a slow flowing, meandering watercourse with an active channel width 
of less than 15 m in the vicinity of the crossing, and low bank structure. Approaches to the 
banks are flat on the west side of the creek, and gently sloping into spruce forest on the 
east side of the creek. Its banks and substrates are predominantly fines (sand). This creek 
supports negligible to low flows (< 1 m3/sec) in the winter. 

A horizontal directional drill is proposed for the crossing (see Figure 13D.B-3). The drill path 
has been shifted to the north of a seismic line that is generally followed by the ROW 
through this area to provide drier, better drained land for the drill set-up area. Drill entry and 
exit points will be located in flat, moderately drained, spruce dominated mixedwood stands, 
approximately 157 m northwest and 143 m southeast of the channel. 

An eight m-wide access trail and associated ice bridge will run along the existing seismic 
line to provide access to the entry and exit points of the drill (see Figure 13D.B-4). The 
alignment of the access trail will take advantage of the gently sloping approach slopes to 
the creek that will require limited grading (see Figure 13D.B-2). The ice bridge will be 
constructed of clean snow salvaged from surface of the frozen channel or adjacent upland 
areas, using a wide pad, low ground pressure dozers, and frozen in with water applications.  
If free water is available beneath the ice, the creek may be used as a source of water for 
the ice bridge.  If not, water will be trucked to the site. Bridge construction will be completed 
in 1 to 2 days.

On the west side of the channel, restoration of the access trail within 20 m of the channel 
(i.e., approximate riparian zone) will involve seeding of the trail with the approved 
reclamation mix for mineral soils.  On the gentle slopes on the east side of the channel, 
restoration may involve the installation of one or two surface diversion berms across the 
access trail to prevent run-off from snowmelt or precipitation events from entering the creek 
(at the discretion of the Environmental Inspectors).  If berms are installed, shrub plantings 
or bundles using local on-site shrub species will be incorporated into the berms to provide 
long term stability and cover. The ice bridge will be notched in one or two locations at the 
time of clean-up to prevent ice jams in the watercourse during break-up. 

13D.B.1.3.3  Hay River 

The Hay River is a slow flowing, meandering watercourse with an active channel width of 
approximately 45 to 50 m in the vicinity of the crossing, and 5 m-high steeply sloping bank 
structure. Approaches to the banks are flat on both sides of the river. Its banks and 
substrates are predominantly fines (sand). This river supports negligible to low flows (< 2 
m3/sec) in the winter.  During low fall and winter flows, large sand bars are regularly 
exposed from the center of the channel to the west bank. 

A horizontal directional drill is proposed for the crossing (see Figure 13D.B-5). The drill path 
generally follows an east-west trending seismic line that is generally followed by the ROW 
through this area. Drill entry and exit points will be located in flat, well drained, spruce and 
balsam poplar dominated mixedwood stands, approximately 159 m west and 127 m east of 
the channel. 

An eight m-wide access trail and associated double span bridge will run between the entry 
and exit points of the drill. The alignment of the access trail will fall slightly to the north of 
the seismic line and drill path to approach the river at right angles to shorten the required 
span length (see Figure 13D.B-6). The bridge crossing structure will incorporate two 30 m 
long temporary bridge spans (prefabricated bridges with guard rails and 5 m of travel room) 
supported in the center of the river channel on temporary pilings resting on drilling mats on 
the exposed mid-channel sand bar within the Hay River (see Figure 13D.B-7). The pilings 
will likely be concrete lock blocks placed on drilling mats for easy retrieval. 

A tracked hoe will be required within the active (although frozen) channel to install the 
support pilings and to assist with the placement of the spans. The hoe will be “walked” 
down the riverbank at the bridge site without significant bank grading to minimize bank 
disturbance. The hoe will be used to level the sand bar as required to provide a safe, flat 
footing for mats and pilings. Once the pilings are in place, the bridge spans would be 
installed, one from either bank. The hoe would be used to support and elevate one end of 
each bridge span as it is pushed towards the pilings, and to direct the span onto the pilings. 
It is anticipated that the installation of the bridge structure would take 48 hours to complete 
with 4 to 6 hours of in-channel activity required for the piling and bridge span placement.

Bridge removal at clean-up will require the use of a track hoe within the channel and large 
dozers on the access trail on either side of the channel. The hoe will lift the bridge sections 
off the piling and, in conjunction with the dozer, will shift each bridge span onto the access 
trail, where the span will be trucked away. The hoe may be required to level out the 
exposed sand bar and repair any damage to the channel banks prior to walking out of the 
channel). 

Because of the flatness of the approaches to the river banks along the access trail, no 
special erosion control measures will be required as part of restoration of the riparian area 
disturbed by the trail or bridge installation on top of the banks. The approaches will be 
seeded to the approved reclamation mix for mineral soils encountered by the project.  
However, some bank recontouring and special reclamation measures will likely be required 
to repair damage to the bank caused by the exit of the hoe from the channel.  At the 
discretion of the Environmental Inspectors, some shrub transplants using locally harvested 
species may be undertaken on the 5 m high banks to replace riparian shrub species and 
bank structure disturbed by the hoe. 

13D.B.1.3.4 Little Hay River 

The Little Hay River is a slow flowing, meandering watercourse with an active channel 
width of approximately 15 m in the vicinity of the crossing, and gently to moderately sloping 
banks that average less than 2 m in height. Approaches to the banks are gently sloping into 
spruce-dominated mixedwood forest on both sides of the creek. Its banks and substrates 
are predominantly fines (sand). This creek supports negligible to low flows (< 1 m3/sec) in 
the winter. 

A horizontal directional drill is proposed for the crossing (see Figure 13D.B-8). The drill path 
has been shifted to the south of an existing winter road and seismic line that is generally 
followed by the ROW through this area to avoid conflicts with the river road and to shorten 
the drill path. Drill entry and exit points will be located in flat, moderately drained, spruce 
dominated mixedwood stands, approximately 129 m northwest and 136 m southeast of the 
channel. 

An existing winter road and associated ice bridge will provide access to the entry/exit point 
of the drill on the west side of the river (see Figures 13D.B-9, 10). A new short access trail 
will be developed between the drill entry/exit point on the east side of the river and the 
east/west trending seismic line followed by the route into Alberta. 

Because an existing winter road and ice bridge will be used to cross the Little Hay River, no 
special reclamation measures will be undertaken in association with the riparian area of the 
watercourse.

13D.B.1.3.5 Unnamed Tributaries 

The unnamed tributary to the Kotcho River, the two tributaries to Townsoitoi Creek, and the 
single tributary to the Hay River crossed by the proposed route are small drainages that 
have been heavily modified by beaver activity.  All have limited bank structure, channel and 
banks dominated by fines, and flat approaches, and all are expected to be frozen to their 
substrates at the time of construction.  

All of these drainages will be crossed with conventional trenching techniques. Should free 
water be present under the ice during construction, then isolation techniques would be 
employed.  All will be equipped with ice bridges, constructed of clean snow salvaged from 
the surface of the frozen channel or adjacent upland areas, using a wide pad, low ground 
pressure dozers, and frozen in with water applications.  If free water is available beneath 
the ice, the creek may be used as a source of water for the ice bridge.  If not, water will be 
trucked to the site. Bridge construction will be completed in less than 1 day.

No special restoration measures are proposed for the crossings.  The approaches will be 
seeded to the approved reclamation mix for mineral soils encountered by the project. The 
ice bridge will be notched in one or two locations at the time of clean-up to prevent ice jams 
in the watercourse during break-up. 

13D.B.2 General Mitigation Measures for Crossings 

13D.B.2.1 HDD Crossings 

13D.B.2.1.1 Drilling Mud Specifications and Management 

Drilling fluid employed at the proposed crossings will be made up primarily of water, 
bentonite, and native soil cuttings. Certain environmentally benign polymers and additives 
may be employed, depending on the actual subsurface conditions encountered.  

13D.B.2.1.1.1 Mud Specifications 

The specific additives to be employed are not known at this time because the directional 
drill contractor has not yet been selected. However, EnCana Ekwan will incorporate a 
requirement for the contractor to specify any additives to be used to drill and install the 
crossings. Drilling will not proceed until all necessary approvals for the use of these 
additives and their disposal are granted. 

13D.B.2.1.1.2 Proposed Drilling Fluid Disposal Method 

EnCana Ekwan will provide a drilling fluid dewatering and solid waste disposal plan to 
comply with all applicable permit requirements. The names of the environmentally benign 
polymers and additives used in the drilling mud will be provided to the regulatory authorities 
concerned before disposal.  

EnCana Ekwan will locate an appropriate site, acquire all applicable permits and transport 
waste to the site. Drilling fluid wastes shall be managed and disposed of in accordance with 
all applicable guidelines and regulations. 

13D.B.2.1.2 Loss of Circulation Contingency 

13D.B.2.1.2.1 Fluid Loss Potential 

With the four HDD crossings planned for the EnCana Ekwan, fractures in the hard clay (till) 
and beds of unconsolidated material, such as loose wet sand, can provide a conduit for 
drilling fluid, leading to loss of circulation. If connected to the surface, this could result in 
drilling mud introductions into the watercourse channels. All four crossings appear to 
possess a naturally consolidated clay mantle overlying the harder till layer, which tends to

EnCana Ekwan Pipeline Inc. 

reduce the potential for lost drilling fluid to circulate to the surface. However, even though 
the risk of such an occurrence is small, a contingency plan is outlined below. 

13D.B.2.1.2.2 Contingency Plan 

To ensure that the potential for an instream drilling mud release is minimized; or if it does 
occur, that negative environmental impacts are minimized, EnCana Ekwan will ensure that 
the Contractor has an instream drilling mud release contingency plan in place. The plan will 
include some or all of the following elements: 
1. Install surface casing at the entry point to a depth that extends beyond the coarsest 

material, if warranted. 
2. Ensure that drilling mud composition is limited to bentonite, fresh water and, if 

warranted, other inert additives. 
3. Construct subsoil berm(s) or sump(s) downslope from the entry point and proposed 

exit point with a capacity adequate to capture anticipated volumes of drilling mud that 
could be release during pullback and other drilling operations. 

4. Install surface casing at the exit point, after completion of the pilot hole if coarse-
textured near-surface deposits could interfere with drilling mud circulation. 

5. Develop a clean-up plan, prior to drilling. The plan will be prepared with the drill 
contractor in consultation with EnCana Ekwan inspection staff. Acquire the appropriate 
approvals to access the release area if off right-of-way and for mud pump-off. 

6. Ensure that supervisory personnel are aware of the contingency plan and clean-up 
plan prior to commencement of drilling activity. 

7. Certain equipment will be required onsite in sufficient quantities during drilling 
operations to contain any inadvertent drilling mud releases. This equipment may 
include sandbags, filter cloth (e.g., silt fence), t-bar posts, post pounders, straw bales, 
light towers, shovels, 6 mil polyethylene and 2 trash pumps c/w sufficient lengths of 
leak free hose and suction heads. 

8. Maintain vacuum trucks onsite during pullback operations. 
9. Maintain the appropriate water quality sampling equipment onsite during drilling 

operations to ensure that accurate water quality samples are taken. Onsite equipment 
to be required by EnCana Ekwan may include turbidity meters, sampling poles, chest 
waders, water sample bottles, ice augers, and coolers. 

10. Ensure that the water quality sampling program is in place prior to drilling. The 
program will be amended if warranted by conditions (i.e., if the watercourse is dry or 
frozen to the substrate).The program will  the following information: 

• sample locations (both an upstream control site as well as appropriate downstream 
sites) 

• frequency of sampling

• sampling procedures 

13D.B.2.1.2.3 Monitoring 

1. Supervisory personnel will be onsite at all times during drilling, reaming and pullback 
operations to ensure that emergency response measures will be implemented 
immediately and effectively. EnCana Ekwan will also assign inspection personnel to 
the site during all phases of drilling of the water body. 

2. Monitor and record the amount of fluid return to the mud tank/pit and the amount of 
make up drilling fluid required in the mixing tanks during drilling of the pilot hole and 
hole opening (reaming). 

3. Monitor both onshore and below channel portions of the drill path and surrounding 
area (i.e., within 200m minimum) for signs of drilling mud release. The size of the area 
to be monitored will be determined by evaluating geotechnical conditions (i.e., amount 
of fracturing, type and depth of substrate) and drilling conditions (i.e., depth of drill 
path, distance between watercourse and entry and exit points). Monitoring will be on a 
continual basis during drilling operations and will continue for at least 12 hours after 
shutdown. Ensure that contact is maintained at all times between monitoring and 
drilling personnel. 

4. Establish monitoring stations at the following locations and obtain water samples for 
visual inspection at the noted intervals (Table 13D.B-2). 

5. Increase the sampling frequency if monitoring of drilling mud returns indicate that a 
release may have occurred.

13D.B.2.1.3 Crossing Abandonment Criteria 

While arbitrary criteria, such as “make at least three attempts and then abandon” are both 
objective and quantitative, they are clearly not the most effective means of ensuring that 
HDD fulfils its mandate of minimizing environmental disturbance or damage, while 
providing a serviceable pipeline crossing. A logical decision making framework is needed, 
underpinned with the best information available at the time the decision must be made. The 
rationale for such a framework must balance the degree of the response to the severity of 
the problem.

As explained below, data quality improves throughout the pilot bore, reaming and pullback 
phases of each drill. During each of these three phases abandonment could be 
contemplated, as illustrated in the sections following Stratigraphy and Certainty. 

13D.B.2.1.3.1 Stratigraphy and Certainty 

Completing each of the four watercourse crossings in a timely fashion is to the advantage 
of all concerned. However, the greatest risk factor for any HDD is unpredictable soil 
behaviour. In order to manage this risk, EnCana Ekwan has commissioned a borehole 
investigation at each crossing, will design each crossing to optimize constructability with the 
subsurface conditions and will hire a competent contractor to install each crossing. 

Although this approach is diligent, subsurface conditions pertinent to an HDD are never 
fully known in detail until after the crossing has been installed. Throughout investigation, 
design and construction, the state of knowledge of subsurface conditions advances 
significantly. Before the borehole investigation, stratigraphy underlying each site is based 
on remote data, such as air photos and regional geological maps and studies. After 
borehole sampling, the general stratigraphy might be more clearly identified, but is still not 
known with 100 percent certainty. At any juncture during the investigation-design-
construction process, subsurface conditions, which may have initially appeared as 
generally benign, can turn out to possess undesirable details, which threaten the likely 
success of pipe pullback. 

13D.B.2.1.3.2 Pilot Deviation Contingency Measures 

Natural variations in stratigraphy encountered by the pilot bottom hole assembly (BHA) can 
interfere with steering accuracy. Occasional large boulders (which have been identified in 
the geotechnical report) can lead to pilot bore deviation. Layers of weak soil can also cause 
problems building angle with the pilot, resulting in the need to adjust pilot-hole 
specifications accordingly. 

If the pilot bore encounters adverse stratigraphic conditions that interfere with steering 
accuracy, then the contractor, inspector and engineer will need to take the appropriate 
action to complete the crossing within the authorized pipeline alignment. Depending on the 
cause and severity of the problem, and its potential consequences to the environment 
and/or pipeline crossing, these actions could include: 

• accepting the new drill path 

• adjusting the depth of the borehole path so that the drill can avoid the problematic 
stratum 

• pulling out, moving over and redrilling the pilot 

• abandoning the pilot and employing an alternative crossing method

13D.B.2.1.3.3 Circulation Loss Contingency Measures 

Fluid loss to the surface has already been addressed in the context of monitoring and 
cleanup. This section addresses fluid loss in the context of remedial responses leading to 
abandonment. Loss of circulation can occur during any of the three phases of the drill. If 
loss of circulation is encountered during any crossing installation phase, then the 
contractor, inspector and engineer will need to assess the extent of fluid loss, determine its 
likely cause and take the best remedial action. These actions could include:

13D.B.2.1.3.4 Pipe Damage Contingency Measures 

If severe pipe damage or collapse is experienced during the pipeline pull, then the 
contractor, inspector and engineer will need to take the appropriate action to complete the 
crossing within specifications. After assessing the damage, determining its likely cause and 
best remedial action, these actions could include: 

• deeming the pipe damage acceptable 

• removing the pipe from the bore, repairing or replacing the pipe, re-reaming the bore 
to the same or larger diameter and re-installing the pipe 

• abandoning the pipe, moving over, and boring a new crossing path (redrill) 

• abandoning the pipe and employing an alternative crossing method (trench)

13D.B.3 Trenched Crossings 

Trenched crossings (with isolation if flowing) will be used as primary crossing techniques 
on the tributary to Kotcho River, tributary to Hay River, and the two unnamed tributaries to 
Townsoitoi Creek. These techniques may also be used at the four named crossings as a 
contingency in the event of failure of the horizontal directional drill crossing. Most crossing 
can be completed within one day, with the exception of the Hay River (if HDD is 
unsuccessful) where excavation and installation may take two to three days.

13D.B.3.1 Methods 

13D.B.3.1.1 Approach Slope and Bank Preparation 

• at least 10 m of undisturbed vegetation will be left between the high water mark of 
the watercourse and any designated extra workspace. Where feasible, extra 
workspace will be located in existing natural openings to reduce clearing 
requirements. The buffer will also be retained during pipeline operations where the 
vegetation management activities will be restricted in the vicinity of a watercourse. 

• any necessary grading of watercourse banks will be minimized wherever feasible 
and where necessary will be directed away from the active channel to minimize any 
potential for watercourse sediment loading 

• within 10 m of the banks of watercrossings, root grubbing will be restricted to 
trenchline and approximately 6 m of workside to facilitate vehicle access and ice 
bridge installations 

• burn areas will not be located within the high water perimeter of a watercourse. All 
partially burnt stumps and logs will be disposed of above the high water mark 

13D.B.3.1.2 In-channel Activities 

It is anticipated that most of the watercourses will be frozen to substrate and not flowing 
during construction. Any flows present are expected to be low (< 1 m3/sec), and easily 
managed with a dam and pump or dam and flume isolation technique: 

• bank grading and pipe preparation and testing will be completed prior to 
commencement of crossing activities where flows are present 

• temporary workspace will be acquired to construct containment sumps for ditch spoil 
storage and trench dewatering prior to beginning of crossing activities 

• instream structures that provide cover for fish (i.e., large woody debris and boulders) 
will be removed from the anticipated area of disturbance before construction 
commences and replaced after construction is complete 

• in frozen conditions, backhoes will work from both sides of the main channel of 
watercourses and ice will be broken and removed from over the ditchline for the 
length necessary for installation of a flume or dam and pump isolation. Care will be 
taken not to allow ice to flow downstream. 

• the spring fisheries field program (see Section 13.8.1.3) will determine the presence 
of any spring spawning habitat on watercourses crossed by the pipeline. Should this 
habitat be found, actions will be taken to shift the final location of trenched crossings 
to avoid conflicts with such habitat. 

• surface substrate material will be prepared as necessary for proper installation of the 
flume section or any dam installation. Cobble will also be removed and salvaged

from the area of excavation across the width of the channel. Salvaged substrate 
material will be stored at a temporary workspace location or on a dry watercourse 
channel location until cleanup. 

• instream work will not begin until early morning following completion of all the above 
preparation activities 

• during the crossing of a fish-bearing watercourse, the isolated area will be searched 
for stranded fish prior to the start of ditching. All fish captured will be released 
downstream from the work site. 

• for a dam and pump installation, an upstream area will be prepared to allow 
installation of a dam structure (i.e., sheet piling, sand bags or potentially an aqua 
dam) for blocking flows that are to be pumped. A downstream dam will only be 
installed if it is needed to keep the isolated area dry. 

• the upstream dam is to be located along the workside boundary edge to provide the 
largest amount of room for the installation of the pipe 

• pumps of sufficient capacity will be installed as required to move watercourse flow 
past the area of isolation. Some streambed excavation may be required for 
adequate installation of the pumps. An energy dissipater, such as a perpendicular 
section of steel pipe, will be used on the downstream end prior to water entry into 
the main channel, where localized erosion is a potential concern. 

• downstream ice will be removed in a amount to provide the water to flow back under 
the existing ice sheet and prevent ponding of water above the channel ice 

• impervious dam materials to be used will be selected by the contractor in 
consultation with the Environmental Inspector and may include: 

• interlocking sheet piling driven into the surface substrate  

• metre bags and plastic sheeting 

• sand bags 

• aqua dams 

• additional pumps (additional 100 percent capacity) shall be available at each flowing 
crossing as a contingency to assist in pump isolation or carry additional clean water 
over the trenchline from the upstream end of the installation 

• hoes will work from both sides of the channel and trenching will begin immediately 
following isolation. Additional hoes and trucks may be used to facilitate spoil material 
handling and loading. 

• if trench dewatering is required, water will be contained in sumps or pumped onto 
stable, well-vegetated areas (located in off-ROW areas) in a manner that does not 
cause erosion or allow any unfiltered water to re-enter the watercourse.

13D.B.3.1.3 Backfill 

• backfilling will commence once the watercourse crossing section is in place and has 
been accepted by EnCana Ekwan 

• backfilling will begin from the watercourse channel and proceed towards both banks 

• ditch water trapped between the main channel and either bank will be pumped to 
settling ponds or onto stable well-vegetated areas or constructed sumps that will not 
allow direct flow back into the watercourse. Discharge areas shall be monitored to 
ensure no flooding, erosion or siltation of the main watercourse occurs.  

• when all instream work activities are completed, the dam and bypass structure will 
be removed 

13D.B.3.2 Water Quality Monitoring 

Monitoring requirements for trenched crossings will be dependent on the findings of the 
fisheries surveys planned for this spring and flows encountered during construction.  Based 
on preliminary investigations and the frozen conditions encountered this winter, it is 
probable that no monitoring will be required.  However, if required, the major objectives of 
the monitoring program will be as follows:  

• monitoring of suspended sediment levels in the vicinity of the watercourse crossings 
according to spatially (transects upstream and downstream) and temporally 
(sampling periods during each of the major construction events) stratified sampling 
regimes 

• determination of the distance of downstream sediment travel with the downstream 
limit and termination of sampling established by existing provincial water quality 
guidelines (i.e., more than 25 mg/L from background levels for 24-h period or more 
than 5 mg/L for longer-term exposure) 

13D.B.3.3 Contingency Planning/Shut-Down Criteria 

The Environmental Inspectors have the responsibility for assuring effective execution of 
environmental design measures relating to crossing activities. Inspectors will have the 
authority to direct contractor personnel to mitigate any potential environmental impact. The 
Environmental Inspector has the authority to and will suspend operations where 
unacceptable situations with adverse environmental implications arise (e.g., where fish or 
fish habitat may be at risk).  

13D.B.3.4 Channel and Bank Restoration 

• As a minimum, contour grading, erosion control and surface stabilization will be 
undertaken at all watercourses and drainages. More detailed bank restoration

measures will be developed following detailed watercourse surveys in spring 2003. 
Potential bank reclamation measures could include the following methods: 

• shrub transplants (i.e., in-tact sod transplants) from on-site areas into riparian zone 

• incorporation of vegetation plugs or shrub facines (bundles) into surface diversion 
berms on approach slopes, using local on-site shrub species  

• installation of geotextile rolls and brush layering at channel edge to reconstructed 
vertical bank structure 

13D.B.3.5 Vehicle Access in the Vicinity of Streams 

13D.B.3.5.1 Access Trails 

All of the named watercourses (i.e., Kyklo Creek, Townsoitoi Creek , the Hay River and the 
Little Hay River) will require the development of access trails other than the ROW to 
accommodate vehicle traffic. Procedures to minimize the impacts of access development in 
the vicinity of watercourse crossings include: 

• prior to the start of construction, the right-of-way boundaries, including pre-approved 
temporary workspace, will be clearly staked to prevent disturbance to unauthorized 
areas 

• all merchantable trees and slash cleared from access trails developed at the named 
crossings will be salvaged and stockpiled for use as rollback during final clean-up  

• nonmerchantable small diameter shrub stands encountered within riparian areas will 
be cleared mechanically, leaving the root mat intact. Where feasible, timber will be 
close-cut to reduce the need to grub and grade the right-of-way for smoothing. Root 
grubbing will be minimized wherever feasible along the entire access trail in order to 
maintain the root mat and improve surface stability. 

• at the time of clean-up, the slash and the trees salvaged during clearing will be rolled 
back in an uncompacted fashion over the entire length of the access trail between 
the HDD exit and entry points and the watercourse channel 

13D.B.3.5.2 Snow and Ice Bridges 

• ice bridges will be constructed of clean snow salvaged from surface of the frozen 
channel or adjacent upland areas, using a wide pad, low ground pressure dozers, 
and frozen in with water applications. 

• If free water is available beneath the ice, the creek may be used as a source of 
water for the ice bridge.  If not, water will be trucked to the site.  

• bridge construction will be completed in 1 to 2 days

• ice bridges will be notched in one or two locations at the time of clean-up to prevent 
ice jams in the watercourse during spring break-up 

• at clean-up, the surface of the bridge will be scraped clean of mud or vegetative 
debris that may have been tracked onto the bridge during construction
