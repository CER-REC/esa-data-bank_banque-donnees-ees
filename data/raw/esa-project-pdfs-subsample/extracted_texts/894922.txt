ADDITIONAL HABITAT COMMENTS  
Flow at this watercourse originates from the outflow of an upstream wetland. Large colonies of 
algae cover the water surface, providing cover, and numerous fish were observed throughout the 
downstream reach. There is beaver activity upstream of the proposed crossing, including both a 
large lodge and partially breached beaver dam.

Waterbody approximately 150 m wide at proposed crossing. Water is heavily overgrown with 
aquatic vegetation and algae. Some areas have depth and open water; some wave action. Soft 
sediment and water depth prevented field crews from accessing deeper reaches and max depths 
are estimated. A second (smaller) wetland is located immediately to the south of the larger 
waterbody, and is isolated by a berm.
