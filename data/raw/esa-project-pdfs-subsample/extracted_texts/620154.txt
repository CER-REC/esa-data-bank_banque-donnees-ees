10.7.2.1 Potential Effect Mechanisms: Effects on Behaviour due to Underwater 
Noise 

The potential effect mechanisms of behavioural change due to underwater noise are the same for NP 
humpback whales as those for NR killer whales and are assessed using the same vessel transit and 
berthing examples.  

Tankers and tugs operating within the CCAA will contribute low frequency underwater sounds to the 
marine environment. Humpback whales are most sensitive to sounds below 1,000 Hz (Richardson et al. 
1995). Therefore, the predominantly low frequency (50 to 500 Hz) underwater sounds of tankers and tugs 
operating within the CCAA will be highly audible to humpback whales. Sounds will be detectable by 
humpback whales over very large areas. Acoustic modelling of sound levels above those of humpback 
whale hearing was not extended to the lower detection limits, but spatial extents presented will specify the 
received sound levels at the furthest extent of modelling. 

As in the NR killer whale assessment, one berthing example and four tug and vessel examples in select 
areas in the CCAA are modelled (see Figure 10-15). 

Berthing 

Approximately four hours of berthing or unberthing will occur daily at the Kitimat Terminal. The 
predicted area in which sound will be audible to humpback whales for berthing extends northward to the 
entrance of Minette Bay; humpback whales will hear sound levels of 35 dB above the threshold up to 
26 km south (to mid-Maitland Island; see Figures 10-15 and 10-16). 

Vessel Transit Operations 

The predicted noise from transiting vessels that would be audible to humpback whales was modelled 
separately in four areas to provide an overall representation of acoustic changes throughout different 
habitats in the CCAA. For predicted sound contours for NP humpback whales at each site, 
see Figure 10-15. 

Transit through Douglas Channel (Kitkiata Inlet) 

The area in which sound will be audible to humpback whales will extend across Douglas Channel 
(average width of roughly 4 to 5 km), and sound levels of 45 dB above the hearing threshold will be 
received up to 22.2 km from the vessels in either direction along the channel (see Figure 10-17).
