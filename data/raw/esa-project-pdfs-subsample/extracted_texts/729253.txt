16 EFFECTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROJECT 

As defined by s.2(1) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEA Act), assessing project effects 
requires considering changes to the Project as a result of the environment. Potential effects of the 
environment on the Project are typically considered during engineering design and are used to identify 
required mitigation measures. 

Potential effects of the environment were identified for all phases of the Project, including design and 
planning, construction and operation. Effects of the environment on a buried pipeline are generally 
restricted to effects that can disturb the pipeline during installation or operation. Several design and 
planning factors are considered to minimize the risk of these effects, including: 

• detailed route selection (avoiding areas of concern); 

• construction scheduling (avoiding historical periods of severe weather where possible); 

• site-specific design; and 

• construction measures (e.g., watercrossing depth and erosion control measures). 

16.1 Potential Effects Addressed During Project Planning 

The Project team has benefited from NGTL’s experience designing, constructing and operating its large 
network of pipelines. The Project team has applied this experience together with industry best practices 
when designing and planning the Project. The potential for identified effects of the environment and the 
nature of such effects are discussed in the subsections following. Where warranted, mitigation measures 
are provided. 

16.2 Severe Weather 

Severe weather is an important consideration in pipeline design, construction and operation. Severe 
weather generally comprises heavy precipitation (potentially resulting in flooding), snow storms and 
blizzards, high winds and lightning. 

Severe weather is normally short term, the effects of which can generally be mitigated through scheduling 
changes and advance identification of potential problems areas (i.e., potential erosion sites). Where 
severe weather conditions have the potential to affect the Project, NGTL will take action to prevent or 
mitigate the potential effects. Such actions may include additional burial depth and erosion control 
measures, and may cause suspension of specific activities until weather conditions abate or effective 
mitigation procedures have been implemented.

16.2.1 Heavy Precipitation 

Incoming low-pressure disturbances can produce extreme precipitation and wind events; however, most 
of these storms are short lived. During fall and winter, these mid-latitude disturbances track across the 
region approximately every two days. 

Extreme precipitation could suspend construction and operation activities. Depending on timing, location 
and magnitude of the precipitation, rain or snowmelt, runoff can cause erosion (e.g., loss of cover over 
the pipelines at localized sites), particularly on disturbed soils.  

Mitigation for the potential effects of precipitation and runoff includes installing adequate drainage 
measures (see EPP, Appendix 20A) for temporary and permanent erosion control measures). Any delays 
in construction caused by weather events are expected to be of short duration. 

During pipeline operation, precipitation may affect access to aboveground facilities, but are not 
anticipated to negatively affect the buried pipeline. Depending on the severity of the weather, regular 
maintenance schedules may be affected; however, delays are expected to be of short duration. 

16.2.2 Extreme Snow Events 

Pacific weather systems interacting with cold Arctic air over the region can cause extreme snowfall 
events. These events are characterized by intense cold, strong winds and reduced visibility. These 
extreme winter events are most likely to occur during February, based on historical trends (Environment 
Canada 1990). Construction could be halted during a snow storm, or if worker safety becomes a concern. 
During operation, extreme snow events could affect the response time for emergency vehicles to reach a 
site of an accidental release, and could slow or delay maintenance activities. However, emergency 
response planning activities typically take such weather events into account. Extreme snow events may 
also affect access to facilities during pipeline operation, but should not adversely affect underground 
pipelines. Regular maintenance schedules may need to be adjusted during a snow storm; however, any 
delays are expected to be of short duration. 

16.2.3 Lightning 

Lightning is unlikely to cause any damage to the buried pipeline. However, lightning storms could cause 
short delays during construction or operation because of safety concerns. The risk of damage to 
aboveground equipment (e.g., block valves and cathodic protection equipment) is considered low. To 
minimize the risk of damage from lightning strikes, aboveground facilities will be grounded according to 
provincial and national building codes. No adverse effects of the environment on the Project are 
anticipated to result from lightning.

16.2.4 High Winds 

High winds are unlikely to cause damage to the buried pipeline and are often associated with severe 
weather events. High winds could result in the suspension of some construction or operation activities, 
though delays are likely to be of short duration.  

16.3 Wildfires 

The construction of the Project is scheduled to start with clearing activities during winter 2012–2013 to 
continue with pipeline construction during late fall and winter 2013–2014. The risk of wildfires during 
winter is low. In the event of a wildfire, construction activities along the affected portions of the pipelines 
could be temporarily suspended. Should a severe wildfire affect large portions of the pipelines, all 
activities may be rescheduled until a later season. Because of the low risk of wildfires affecting the winter 
construction, there is no further consideration made to wildfires in the assessment. 

During the operation phase, forest fires are unlikely to adversely affect the buried pipeline; however, they 
could affect aboveground facilities. NGTL has emergency response procedures in place for its entire 
operations and in the event of a wildfire, NGTL would implement its emergency response plan and fire 
contingency plan.  

16.4 Residual Effects Assessment 

Any effects on the Project caused by heavy precipitation, extreme snow events, lightning, high winds or 
wildfires are expected to be negative, short term, low magnitude, site specific, sporadic in frequency, 
reversible and, therefore, not significant. Prediction confidence is high.

17 ACCIDENTS AND MALFUNCTIONS 

In addition to assessing project-specific effects, s.16.1(a) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
(CEA Act) requires that every screening consider the environmental effects of accidents and malfunctions 
that may occur in connection with a project. The following are project-related accidents and malfunctions 
that may occur during construction and operation: 

• equipment failure and accidental spill of hazardous materials (e.g., fuel) during construction and 
operation;  

• fires (for wildfire, see Section 17.3); 

• release of drilling mud during horizontal directional drilling (HDD); 

• transportation accidents; and 

• pipeline failure during operation, resulting in an accidental release of natural gas. 

The operation and maintenance of equipment during construction will result in the presence of hazardous 
materials onsite. Materials that are likely to be found on construction sites include:  

• fuels (gasoline, diesel and propane); 

• lubricants (engine oil, transmission or drive train oil, hydraulic oil, gear oil and lubricating grease); 

• coolants (ethylene glycol and propylene glycol); 

• methanol; 

• paints; and 

• solvents. 

Hazardous liquids pose the greatest threat to the environment because of their ability to flow in an 
uncontrolled manner and seep into porous material if not properly contained. Some liquids (e.g., 
lubricating oil, methanol and antifreeze) contain components that are toxic to plants and wildlife. In 
addition, many of these materials are readily flammable or explosive. Antifreeze (ethylene glycol) is toxic 
and has a sweet smell that may attract wildlife. Inadvertent spills or a fire could result in contamination or 
alteration of soil, plants and ecological communities, surface or underground water quality, riparian 
habitat, wetland function, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and human health. Further damage to soils, 
vegetation and habitat could occur during spill clean-up and reclamation efforts following a spill. 

To minimize the risk of an accidental release, accident or malfunction, the following mitigation measures 
are recommended:  

• equipment should be in good working order and regularly maintained; 

• crews should be properly trained to handle hazardous materials and wastes; 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 17: Accidents and Malfunctions 
October 2011 

 

17-2   

 

• all Project personnel should receive training and be required to comply with regulations for the 
containment, handling and disposal of potentially hazardous materials; 

• all Project personnel should be aware of their responsibilities in the case of a spill; 

• should hazardous liquids enter the environment, localized contamination may be required, with either 
the contaminated soil being removed or treated on-site; 

• the spill contingency plan (see Appendix 20A) should be implemented in the event of an accidental 
release of hydrocarbons; 

• Alberta One-Call should be used to identify foreign line crossings; 

• foreign line crossings should be located and clearly marked before any ground disturbance during 
construction and operation; and 

• in the event of a rupture, NGTL’s emergency response plan should be followed. 

Measures to address the potential for accidental spills during construction are outlined in the 
environmental protection plan (EPP, see Appendix 20A). These measures will apply to contractors and 
ensure mitigation of any potential effects.  

Fires are a serious concern when working with highly flammable gases. A fire during construction or 
operation may adversely affect adjacent vegetation, and in rare situations wildlife or adjacent property.  

To minimize the risk of fire caused by construction or operation, the following fire prevention measures 
and responses are recommended: 

• crews should participate in a safety and environmental training session that includes instruction on 
how to properly use fire suppression equipment; 

• all Project personnel should be aware of proper disposal and storage of flammable materials and 
sources of flame or spark; 

• crews should ensure equipment with exhaust and engine systems are in good working order and 
regularly maintained; 

• crews should use Alberta One-Call;  

• the fire prevention and suppression contingency plan (see Appendix 20A) should be implemented in 
the event of a fire; and 

• in the event of a rupture, follow NGTL’s emergency response plan. 

Depending on the volume and location of the release of HDD mud (frac-out) on land or into a 
watercourse, wetland or drainage, the release may adversely affect aquatic ecosystems or affect soil 
productivity.

To mitigate potential damaging effects resulting from release of HDD mud, the following measures are 
recommended: 

• use nontoxic, bentonite clay-based material as drilling mud; and 

• in the event of a release, follow the directional drilling procedures and instream drilling mud release 
contingency plan (see Appendix 20A) should be followed, which contains protocols to monitor, 
contain, and clean-up a potential frac-out and an alternative method for carrying out the crossing. 

Transportation accidents can result in serious injury or death to humans and wildlife, as well as damage 
to property or critical habitat (if fire or chemical spillage occurs in conjunction with the accident). To 
prevent vehicle-related accidents, crews will participate in a safety and environmental training session 
and will be required to follow all traffic, road-use and safety laws. 

The pipeline will be controlled from the NGTL OCC (operations control centre) located in Calgary, Alberta. 
The OCC is staffed 24 hours per day, and uses a comprehensive supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) system to continuously monitor and control pipeline operations. 

17.1 Residual Effects Assessment 

Any effects caused by accidents and malfunctions during construction and operation are expected to be 
negative, short term, low magnitude, site-specific, sporadic in frequency, reversible and, therefore, not 
significant. Prediction confidence is high.

18 CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ASSESSMENT 

18.1 Introduction 

In addition to assessing project-specific effects, s.16.1(a) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
(CEA Act) requires that every screening consider cumulative environmental effects that might result from 
the Project in combination with other projects or activities that have been or will be carried out.  

18.2 Methods 

18.2.1 Assessment Methods 

Cumulative effects assessments were completed for all disciplines that completed residual project effects 
assessments: 

• Vegetation and Wetlands (Section 7); 

• Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat (Section 8); 

• Fish and Fish Habitat (Section 10); 

• Socio-economic Assessment (Section 13); and 

• Traditional Land and Resource Use (Section 14). 

The screening-level cumulative effects assessment was completed for identified project residual effects. If 
a project residual effect might act cumulatively with those of other projects and activities and the resulting 
cumulative effects might exceed acceptable levels without implementation of project-specific or regional 
mitigation, a more detailed cumulative effects assessment was also completed. Significance of potential 
cumulative effects was determined based on the detailed assessment. 

18.2.2 Identification of Existing and Planned Development 

18.2.2.1 Project Inclusion List 

The cumulative effects assessment involved determining whether any existing or reasonably foreseeable 
projects and activities near the Project are anticipated to have identifiable residual effects. It further 
determines whether any of those effects, combined with the residual effects of the Project, would change 
the overall level of an effect on a specific valued ecosystem component (VEC) or valued socio-economic 
component (VSC). Cumulative effects were assessed based on the following three scenarios: 

• Base Case: includes all existing development; 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

18-2   

 

• Application Case: includes development in the Base Case plus the Project footprint; and 

• Planned Development Case: includes development in the Base Case, the Project footprint and 
reasonably foreseeable future development. 

If the residual effects of the Project are not expected to overlap with effects from other identified projects 
and activities, then it was concluded the Project would not contribute to cumulative effects, and no further 
analysis of cumulative effects was done. If residual effects of the Project are expected to overlap with 
residual effects from other identified projects and activities, then a cumulative effects assessment was 
completed for that VEC or VSC. 

Existing, approved and planned developments were identified within a 15 km radius (30 km corridor) 
around the two proposed pipelines (see Table 18-1 and Figures 18-1 to 18-2). The list of existing, 
approved and planned developments was used in cumulative effects assessment for all disciplines except 
air quality.  

Spatial extent of existing development was identified from the following sources: 

• British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission Land and Resource Data Warehouse (OGC 2011a,); 

• Alberta Sustainable Resource Development Digital Integrated Dispositions (SRD 2011); and 

• 2.5 m colour SPOT satellite imagery. 

Although not identified explicitly in the cumulative effects assessment, existing forestry cut blocks and 
wildfire footprints were considered in the project residual effects assessment as existing disturbances. 
Existing cut block data for British Columbia was available through the British Columbia Oil and Gas 
Commission Land and Resource Data Warehouse (OGC 2011a). Existing cut block data for Alberta was 
not available in the SRD Digital Integrated Dispositions spatial database. However, existing disturbances 
(including cut blocks and wildfires) were classified as “disturbed” classes in both the vegetation mapping 
compiled and created for the local study area (LSA) and in the available land cover classification 
(GeoBase 2011) for the regional study area (RSA) for British Columbia and Alberta. 

Approved and planned projects were identified from the following sources: 

• NEB Major Applications and Projects (NEB 2011); 

• Canadian Environmental Assessment Registry (CEA Agency 2011); 

• ERCB Integrated Application Registry (ERCB 2011); 

• Inventory of Major Alberta Projects (Government of Alberta 2011); 

• Alberta Environment Environmental Assessment Activity Reports (AENV 2011); 

• British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission Industry Activity Levels (OGC 2011b); 

• British Columbia Major Projects Inventory (BCMF 2010); 

• British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office Project Information Centre (EAO 2011); 

• British Columbia iMap Natural Information Service (BC iMap 2011);

18.3 Vegetation and Wetlands 

18.3.1 Screening for Cumulative Environmental Effects 

With respect to vegetation resources, the screening of the Project’s potential contribution to the 
cumulative effects of base case, application case, and future development case considers the following 
criteria to determine if assessment of cumulative effects might exceed acceptable thresholds. Additional 
assessment is warranted if: 

• the Project results in a demonstrable residual effect; 

• residual effects are likely to act in a cumulative fashion with those of other projects; and  

• there is a reasonable expectation that the Project’s contribution to cumulative effects will affect the 
viability or sustainability of vegetation resources. 

A cumulative environmental effects assessment is warranted if residual project effects to vegetation or 
wetlands act cumulatively with those of other projects and activities in the RSA, and the resulting 
cumulative effects might exceed acceptable levels without implementation of project-specific or regional 
mitigation. The effects of the Project are not predicted to have a significant effect on vegetation or 
wetlands; however, even non-significant changes to vegetation and wetland resources and function can 
act cumulatively with other activities and need to be considered. See Tables 18-2 and 18-3 for a 
screening of potential cumulative effects.

The proposed Project is largely within areas that have been disturbed previously by forestry, mining, and 
oil and gas development. Specifically, for the base case, 18% and 29% of the planned Project footprints 
for the Komie North and Chinchaga sections are already disturbed, respectively. The Project proposes to 
clear an additional 298 ha in the Komie North Section and 74 ha along the Chinchaga Section. The 
Project will parallel existing linear development for more than 60% of the planned length.  

Although the vegetation in these areas will be altered to some degree during construction, the overall 
footprint is small, and care will be taken (with appropriate mitigation), to avoid adverse effects to 
vegetation resources. Further, any project disturbance will be minimized and quickly re-vegetated (e.g., 
invasive plant management), with the focus to maintain the function and viability of vegetation and 
wetland communities.  

The residual effects to rare plants, rare ecosystems, wetland community diversity and landscape 
vegetation diversity are expected to be relatively small and, for the most part, reversible. From a 
landscape perspective the effects to vegetation resources associated with the Project are minor, or 
negligible in the case of old forests.  

In summary, the overall cumulative effects to vegetation resources and are not expected to affect the viability 
or sustainability of vegetation resources given that: 

• the existing level of Base Case disturbance within the Project footprint and RSA; 

• the small footprint and looping nature of the Project in the Application Case; 

• the Project is not expected to create any residual effects to vegetation resources; and 

• the existing planned future development within the RSA is expected to be only 1.4% and 3.2 % for the 
Komie and Chinchaga section respectively. 

Therefore, given the above information further assessment of cumulative effects to vegetation resources 
is not warranted.   

18.4 Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 

18.4.1 Screening for Cumulative Environmental Effects 

A cumulative environmental effects assessment is warranted if residual project wildlife and wildlife habitat 
effects act cumulatively with those of other projects and activities in the RSA, and the resulting cumulative 
effects might exceed acceptable levels without implementation of project-specific or regional mitigation. 
The effects of the Project are not predicted to have a significant effect on wildlife; however, even non-
significant alterations to habitat, movement or mortality can act cumulatively with other activities and need 
to be considered. See Table 18-4 for a screening of potential cumulative effects.

18.4.1.1 Habitat 

The Project will result in residual effects on habitat in both project sections, although these effects are not 
considered significant (less than 20% temporary habitat change in LSA, see Section 8.3). Residual 
project effects on habitat availability are expected to be positive for common nighthawk and neutral for 
moose, but will be adverse for the other species. Even though the identified effects are very small, they 
will act in a cumulative fashion with the effects of other past, current or future projects and activities. 
Hydrocarbon development, and transportation, all involve removing vegetation from the area being 
developed, which results in at least short-term alteration of some wildlife habitat. Indirect loss of habitat 
adjacent to development might also result from sensory disturbance and avoidance of humans and 
predators. 

Habitat loss can also occur through mechanisms other than development. An important source of habitat 
change in the boreal forest is mountain pine beetle. While beetle-killed stands can be used by olive-sided 
flycatcher and woodpeckers, these stands are typically harvested, creating artificially disturbed forest that 
frequently have relatively high predation rates (Altman and Sallabanks 2000; Robertson and Hutto 2007) 
and are therefore low quality habitat. Unharvested beetle-killed pine stands are at high risk of burning, 
which also results in alteration of wildlife habitat.  

BASE CASE 

A number of developments occur within the RSA of both sections under Base Case, including pipelines, 
wells, gas plants, transmission lines, cutblocks, seismic lines and roads. All of these features contribute to 
current loss of wildlife habitat prior to the introduction of the Project onto the landscape. Disturbances 
account for a relatively small proportion of the land cover under Base Case, with well over 80% of the 
LSA in each section available to wildlife. This suggests that under Base Case, current levels of habitat 
alteration are unlikely to have resulted in significant changes to wildlife populations. Some species, such 
as for moose, likely use pipeline and transmission line right-of-way (RoW) for foraging, and could actually 
gain habitat for some life requisites. 

APPLICATION CASE 

The Project will add incrementally to habitat loss caused by existing disturbances. The Project represents 
a relatively small disturbance footprint in both sections, with no significant changes in habitat availability 
for any of the species assessed. Because less than 20% of wildlife habitat in the LSA was affected by the 
Project, the Project will not contribute significantly to effects at the RSA scale for any species. 

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT CASE 

Although predicted habitat losses of the Application Case are well under the 20% threshold identified for 
the species assessed, habitat alteration associated with future projects might result in exceedances of 
this threshold and subsequent effects on wildlife abundance and viability. Future projects and activities 
have the potential to interact with the Project and other existing disturbances (Base Case). These projects

are primarily pipeline projects. In general, few projects have been identified, and many of them are 
looping projects. The areal extent of the future projects is relatively small, ranging between 51.9 ha 
(Chinchaga Section) and 161.1 ha (Komie North Section). Planned Development Case disturbance, 
including baseline, project and future developments, will account for 1.4% (Komie North section) to 3.2% 
(Chinchaga section) of the RSA (see Table 18-5). Therefore, residual cumulative effects on habitat are 
not expected to exceed acceptable thresholds (20% habitat change) within the RSA for Komie North or 
Chinchaga sections, and therefore, further assessment was not necessary.

NOTE:

18.4.1.2 Mortality Risk 

Mortality risk was scoped out as a potential effect on wildlife in both sections of the Project where the 
project disturbance was contiguous with another linear development. Therefore, cumulative effects will 
only be addressed for the new cut area of the Komie North Section. In addition, residual project effects on 
mortality are assessed only for boreal caribou and grizzly bear. The Maxhamish caribou herd, with which 
the Komie North Section intersects, has a population estimated of 306 animals (Environment Canada 
2008) with very low calf survival due to predation (Rowe 2007). The Project also occurs in the Taiga 
Grizzly Bear Population Unit (GBPU), which was estimated to have a population of 92 bears in 2008 
(Hamilton 2008). Hamilton et al. (2004) suggested that GBPUs with fewer than 100 bears be closed to 
hunting because the conservation risk of hunting such a small population was too high. However, the 
Taiga GBPU is still considered to be viable (Hamilton 2008). 

BASE CASE 

Linear features on the landscape are known to adversely affect boreal caribou and grizzly bear. Linear 
features identified in the Base Case include pipeline and powerline RoW, roads and seismic lines, among 
which seismic lines were most prevalent (see Section 8, Table 8-17). Under Base Case conditions the 
density of linear features in the new cut area of the Komie North Section LSA and UWR-Type 
A-BCAR020 (Caribou RSA) was considered low at 0.42 km/km2, and therefore does not exceed any 
identified threshold for boreal caribou in this region (see Section 8.1.7.1 for a rationale on the threshold). 
The density of open road features (excluding seismic) under Base Case conditions was 0.02 km/km2, well 
below the recommended threshold of 0.6 km/km2 for grizzly bear (Guyg et al. 2004; SRD and ACA 2010). 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

  18-15 

 

APPLICATION CASE 

The Project will add incrementally to existing linear features at Base Case, resulting in a density of 
0.50 km/km2 of linear features for boreal caribou (see Section 8, Table 8-17). For grizzly bear it was 
assumed that the project RoW could serve as a tertiary access route for hunters and poachers, and 
therefore when combined with existing open roads, the density increases to 0.04 km/km2. Although these 
density values are still well below recognized thresholds, NGTL acknowledges the importance of 
mitigating any potential effects on boreal caribou and grizzly bear, and has committed to a suite of 
mitigation measures listed in the Environmental Protection Plan, including rollback to prevent access to 
the RoW (see Section 20). 

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT CASE 

Any future linear features, including roads, pipeline or powerline RoWs, or seismic lines, would add 
incrementally to the Application Case and contribute to cumulative effects on mortality risk of wildlife. 
Other pipeline projects are planned within the RSA but are looping (e.g., Tanghe Creek Lateral Loop 
No. 2 Cranberry Section) and will therefore not contribute to linear density. New pipeline RoW has the 
potential to serve as access corridors for humans and predators, but with the application of appropriate 
mitigation, such as use of rollback and access control, effects on mortality will likely be minimal. Based on 
reasonably foreseeable projects, cumulative mortality risk is unlikely to threaten the sustainability of 
boreal caribou or grizzly bear in the region, and is therefore considered not significant. No further 
assessment was necessary. 

18.4.1.3 Wildlife Movement 

Effects of the Project on wildlife movement were assessed only for smaller species including birds, small 
mammals and amphibians, because larger species were assumed to be able to traverse the RoW without 
difficulty. Moose and grizzly bear will likely be attracted to the RoWs for forage and ease of movement. 
The cumulative effects assessment therefore focused on smaller species, although potential effects on 
large mammals will be addressed as appropriate. 

BASE CASE 

At Base Case, disturbances including pipelines, wells, gas plants, transmission lines, cutblocks, seismic 
lines, and roads have the potential to disrupt movement of birds, small mammals and amphibians. As 
reviewed in the wildlife project effects assessment (see Section 8.3.3), however, most species do not 
encounter barrier effects when attempting to cross features less than 100 m wide. The width of Base 
Case disturbances was not determined, but it was assumed that the majority of linear features was less 
than 100 m wide, and therefore did not act as barriers to movement. Non-linear features such as 
cutblocks are a greater concern for habitat availability than movement; for example, Schmiegelow and 
Hannon (1999) found that some songbirds were absent from forest patches smaller than 10 ha.

18-16   

 

APPLICATION CASE 

The addition of the project RoW in the contiguous sections will increase the width of existing RoW by 
32 m (see Table 18-6). The widest RoW will be associated with the Chinchaga section (72 m wide), 
followed by Komie North (contiguous) at 65 m, and Komie North (new cut) at 32 m. In all areas, the width 
of the RoW is unlikely to act as an impermeable barrier to movement for any species.

Development

Komie North (new cut) 32 
Komie North (contiguous) 65 
Chinchaga 72 
NOTE 
1 Average width of project, including temporary work space, and adjacent RoW. 

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT CASE 

Any future linear features would add incrementally to the Application Case and contribute to cumulative 
effects on wildlife movement. For example, Tanghe Creek Lateral Loop No. 2 Cranberry section will 
parallel an existing pipeline, but not the Project. In addition, the combined total RoW width would be much 
less than 100 m. As residual cumulative effects on wildlife are not expected to exceed identified 
thresholds, particularly with effective use of mitigation measures, further assessment of cumulative effects 
on wildlife movement was not considered necessary. 

18.4.2 Summary 

• A number of new pipelines and wells, a gas plant and a compressor station were identified as projects 
planned for the RSA within the foreseeable future. 

• Cumulative changes in habitat availability are not expected to exceed the 20% threshold within the 
RSA. 

• Cumulative linear feature density is unlikely to exceed the thresholds identified for boreal caribou and 
grizzly bear in the RSA, because the majority of proposed pipeline construction will be looped and will 
therefore not contribute to linear feature density. Therefore, cumulative mortality risk is unlikely to 
threaten the sustainability of boreal caribou or grizzly bear in the region, and therefore, further 
assessment was not necessary. 

• Cumulative changes to wildlife movement are unlikely to be significant because even for looping 
projects, ROW widths are not expected to exceed the 100 m threshold.

18.5 Fish and Fish Habitat 

18.5.1 Screening for Cumulative Environmental Effects 

18.5.1.1 Cumulative Effects on Fish Habitat 

Although no significant residual effects on productive capacity of fish habitat are predicted to occur 
because of pipeline construction and roads, localized alterations of fish habitat will occur at moderate risk 
crossings. To satisfy DFO’s Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat objective of net gain of productivity 
of fish habitat and the corresponding conservation guiding principle of no-net-loss of productivity of fish 
habitat, effective reclamation or habitat compensation for these losses will be required. It is anticipated 
that with effective construction and reclamation works, no-net-loss of habitat productive capacity is 
predicted.  

Provided DFO agrees that no-net-loss can be achieved with the implementation of the reclamation plan, 
any adverse residual environmental effects on the productive capacity of fish habitat will be avoided and 
there will be no residual effect on fish habitat. Consequently, pipeline watercourse crossings for the 
Project will not contribute to cumulative effects in the assessment area. 

18.5.1.2 Cumulative Effects on Fish Mortality 

Potential changes in fish health and mortality from project activities are anticipated to be low because of 
detailed crossing design, effective mitigation measures, and the short-term duration of effects. Therefore, 
no residual risk to fish populations is anticipated from construction and operation of the Project. As a 
result, no cumulative effects are predicted for this aspect of the Project. 

18.5.1.3 Cumulative Effects on Water Quality 

Potential changes in water quality from project activities are anticipated to be low due to the 
implementation of proven, effective, mitigation measures and the short-term duration of effects. 
Therefore, no residual risk to water quality is anticipated from construction and operation of the Project. 
As a result, no cumulative effects are predicted for this aspect of the Project. 

18.6 Socio-Economic Assessment 

18.6.1 Screening for Cumulative Effects 

This section evaluates the residual socio-economic effects directly associated with the Project in 
combination with the residual effects arising from other projects and activities that have been or will be 
carried out in the Project’s socio-economic LSA and RSA. Existing and proposed developments have the 
potential for both a temporal overlap during construction and operation and a physical overlap with the 
socio-economic LSA and RSA. Table 18-7 identifies potential project interactions between existing and 
proposed projects and the Project’s VSCs with residual socio-economic effects.

18.6.1.1 Cumulative Effects to Environmentally Significant and Protected Areas 

The Project intersects areas that have been identified as important for wildlife values, e.g., core caribou 
habitat. Cumulative effects assessment on wildlife and wildlife habitat are addressed in Section 18.5. No 
recreational-related protected areas are in the project LSAs and RSAs. The Project’s cumulative effects 
related to disturbance of land users’ visual and sensory environment is addressed in Section 18.8.3. 

18.6.1.2 Cumulative Effects to Emergency Services 

Potential residual effects associated with Emergency Services identified in Section 13 include an 
unplanned event occurring during construction or operation that would lead to the need for local and 
regional emergency services. As a result of the extensive mitigation and precautionary measures in place 
related to safety, this potential residual effect of the Project is considered to be not likely to occur and a 
cumulative effects assessment for Emergency Services was not conducted. 

18.6.1.3 Cumulative Effects to Employment and Economy 

Potential cumulative effects associated with the construction and operation of the Project on employment 
and economy are: increased contract procurement opportunities; increased local employment 
opportunities; and the generation of revenue for municipal, provincial and federal governments. In 
accordance with Guide A.2.7 of the NEB Filing Manual, further analysis of these residual effects is not 
provided since these effects have been determined to have a positive residual effect (see Section 13).  

18.6.1.4 Cumulative Effects to Other Energy and Resource Industries 

The potential cumulative effect associated with the construction and operation of the Project on other 
energy and resources industries is the reduced availability of land for these other uses. Project 
contributions to this cumulative effect have been reduced by using existing pipeline rights-of-way for 
access as much as possible and by using previously disturbed areas for stockpile sites and temporary 
construction sites. Although project environmental effects act cumulatively with those of other projects 
and activities, the resulting cumulative effects are unlikely to exceed acceptable levels with the application 
of mitigation measures. A cumulative effects assessment was not conducted. 

18.6.2 Assessment of Cumulative Effects to Social and Cultural Well-being 

The Project is located in areas where substantial industrial development is occurring and near permanent 
population centers. There are existing sources of disruption of community residents from temporary 
workforces visiting communities, using local services and travelling on local roads. Existing activities, the 
Project and known future developments could act cumulatively to disrupt community residents. 

A qualitative assessment of the cumulative effects to social and cultural well-being was deemed to be the 
most appropriate approach for evaluating the significance of potential cumulative environmental effects 
given the short duration of the project construction and the lack of quantifiable data. Consequently, the 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

18-20   

 

evaluation of significance of the potential cumulative residual effect relied on the professional judgment of 
the assessment team.  

18.6.2.1 Base Case 

The Project is located in areas where there are numerous industrial developments. There are two 
permanent industrial camps found in the Komie North Section RSA. An estimation of the number of 
people residing in these camps is not available. There are no permanent industrial camps found in the 
RSA of the Chinchaga Section. It is assumed there are several temporary industrial camps at any given 
time in the project socio-economic RSA. The numbers of workers and locations associated with the 
temporary industrial camps are not available.  

It is assumed that workers associated with existing permanent facilities such as the operation of gas 
plants reside in nearby communities and do not contribute to a temporary work force.  

18.6.2.2 Application Case 

Temporary construction camps will be located near each pipeline and each will house between 50 and 
500 workers each month during the construction timeframe (November 2013 to April 2014). Workers in 
these camps could visit the nearby communities interacting with them and using the local facilities and 
services. The construction workers associated with the Project could interact with workers from existing 
projects in the RSA and act cumulatively on community social and cultural well-being.  

18.6.2.3 Planned Development Case 

It is anticipated that known future developments will house construction workers in camps and could 
disrupt community social and cultural well-being in the socio-economic RSA. Of the future projects 
identified in Table 18-8, one project (Fortune Creek Gas Plant) has the potential to be constructed 
concurrently with the Komie North Section and will interact cumulatively with the Project. 

18.6.2.4 Mitigation of Cumulative Effect to Social and Cultural Well-being  

Mitigation measures found in Section 13.1.5.1 are expected to address cumulative effects to Social and 
Cultural Well-being. No additional social and cultural well-being cumulative effect mitigation measures 
beyond the project-specific mitigation measures are warranted.  

18.6.2.5 Residual Cumulative Effect to Social and Cultural Well-being  

The Project will act cumulatively with existing developments and one known future development in the 
socio-economic RSA resulting in a disruption of local or community residents. The sources of disruption 
include the temporary workforces visiting communities using local services and travelling on local roads. 
Without knowing the number of people residing in the existing and temporary industrial work camps at 
any given time in the RSA, it is difficult to predict the Project’s contribution to the disruption of social and 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

  18-21 

 

cultural well-being. Of the future projects identified in Table 18-8, one project (Fortune Creek Gas Plant) 
has the potential to be constructed concurrently with the Komie North Section and will interact 
cumulatively with the Project during construction. Project contributions to cumulative effects to social and 
cultural well-being have been reduced by stressing the need for the safe and respectful use of community 
facilities and the need for respectful behaviour while travelling outside of camp will be discussed with the 
workforce during the orientation sessions. In addition, zero tolerance will be enforced for unruly behaviour 
and illegal drug use. It is assumed that existing and known future developments occurring in the socio-
economic RSA do employ or will employ similar measures.  

The direction of the residual cumulative effect to disruption of community residents from temporary 
workforces is considered to be adverse. The magnitude of this adverse residual cumulative effect is 
expected to be medium given the small number of known camps in the area, the short duration of the 
construction schedule and the small number of known future projects that will overlap with the Project’s 
construction timeframe. The geographic extent is expected to be the regional, as the residual cumulative 
effect will extend into the RSA. The duration will be short-term, as it is expected that the cumulative 
increase to disruption of community residents from temporary workforces is confined to the Project’s 
construction phase, and the frequency will be once, as it will occur only during the construction phase. 
The residual cumulative effect to disruption of community residents from temporary workforces is 
expected to be reversible upon completion of construction. The residual cumulative effect is expected to 
be not significant. The probability of occurrence of the residual cumulative effect is high because 
construction of the Project in combination with existing activities and known future development will result 
in disruption of community residents from temporary workforces. The level of confidence in the 
determination of significance is low based on the difficulty in predicting how people perceive a temporary 
increase in a construction workforce and the assumptions made. 

18.6.3 Assessment of Cumulative Effects to Visual and Sensory Environment 

The Project is located in areas with active industrial development and development related activities. The 
presence of existing projects in the socio-economic RSA such as oil and gas, forestry and transportation 
activities have resulted in a change in viewscape in the project RSAs. The Project could interact with the 
existing and known future development. 

There are existing sources of sensory disturbance in the socio-economic RSA such as oil and gas, 
forestry and transportation activities resulting in sources of noise and air emissions, vehicle and 
equipment traffic, overflights, on-going pipeline maintenance activities and operation of existing facilities 
resulting in sensory disturbance to land users. All project-related activities involving the use of equipment 
could interact with these existing and known future activities and cumulatively effect the sensory 
environment. 

A quantitative approach was selected to determine the cumulative effect of the Project on alteration of 
viewscapes since the change in this parameter in comparison to existing conditions can be quantified. 
However, it is difficult to predict how people perceive cumulative change and the confidence in the

18-22   

 

accuracy of the results is low. Nonetheless, the quantitative assessment does facilitate the comparison of 
project-related contributions to those effects associated with existing and known future developments.  

A qualitative assessment of increased sensory disturbance was deemed to be the most appropriate 
method to evaluate the significance of the potential residual cumulative environmental effects given the 
short duration of project construction and lack of quantifiable data. There are no established thresholds, 
standards or guidelines relating to the reduction in land base for forestry; therefore, the evaluation of 
significance relied on the professional judgment of the assessment team. 

18.6.3.1 Base Case  

The RSA is located where land use plans have designated or allowed for industrial use, at locations not 
readily accessible to nearby communities and at a substantial distance from tourist corridors. However, 
the RSAs are used by resident and Aboriginal hunters, fishers and trappers. Existing activities such as oil 
and gas developments, transmission lines and roads contribute to an existing alteration of the viewscape. 
For the purpose of the cumulative effect assessment, it has been assumed that any activity that clears 
trees can alter the viewscape. Table 18-8 identifies the alteration of viewscape within the socio-economic 
RSA for each pipeline.  

In the RSAs, there is a limited amount of ambient noise due to the remoteness of the areas. Existing 
activities contributing to sensory disturbance include local and industrial vehicle traffic, industrial 
maintenance activities and operation of existing facilities. No active forestry dispositions were located in 
the Komie North Section RSA but forestry does occur in the Chinchaga Section RSA.

18.6.3.2 Application Case 

Project footprint preparation and RoW clearing will alter the viewscape in the immediate vicinity of each 
pipeline. Table 18-8 identifies the estimated area of potential alteration of viewscape for each pipeline 
attributed to the Project. 

Project activities such as over flights, maintenance and other operational activities that may contribute to 
sensory disturbance are of a very short-term nature. Increased sensory disturbance is anticipated to be 
greater during the construction phase when compared to the operational phase. The construction phase 
will involve more pieces and types of heavy construction equipment and will last longer than the 
maintenance activities. Consequently, the potential for a cumulative increase in sensory disturbance for 
land users is greatest during the construction phase of the Project. The construction period is the focus of 
the cumulative effects assessment for this sensory disturbance.  

18.6.3.3 Planned Development Case 

It is anticipated that known future developments will alter viewscapes in the socio-economic RSA. 
Table 18-8 identifies the estimated affected area that is attributed to the known future projects. 

It is anticipated that known future developments within the socio-economic RSA will also increase 
sensory disturbance during construction. Of the future projects identified in Table 18-7, one project 
(Fortune Creek Gas Plant) might be constructed concurrently with the Komie North Section.  

18.6.3.4 Mitigation of Cumulative Effect to Visual and Sensory Environment  

Mitigation measures found in Section 13.3.2.2 are expected to address cumulative effects to the Visual 
and Sensory Environment. No additional visual and sensory environment cumulative effect mitigation 
measures beyond the project-specific mitigation measures were warranted.  

18.6.3.5 Residual Cumulative Effect to Visual and Sensory Environment 

The results of the quantitative analysis of the alteration of viewscapes are summarized in Table 18-8. In 
the Komie North Section RSA, approximately 5,078 ha (1.5%) of the viewscape has been altered due to 
existing activities. When combined with the Komie North Section footprint and known future 
developments, the total cumulative alteration of viewscapes is predicted to be approximately 6,451 ha, 
which increases the percentage of the Komie North Section socio-economic RSA with an altered 
viewscape to 1.9%. The Komie North Section contributes 4.6% to the total cumulative alteration of 
viewscape.  

In the Chinchaga Section RSA, approximately 5,246 ha (3.2%) of the viewscape has been altered due to 
existing activities. When combined with the Chinchaga Section footprint and known future developments, 
the total cumulative alteration of viewscapes is predicted to be approximately 5,565 ha, which increases 
the percentage of the Chinchaga Section socio-economic RSA with an altered viewscape to 3.3%. The 
Chinchaga Section contributes 1.6% to the total cumulative alteration of viewscape.  



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

18-24   

 

Overall, approximately 10,504 ha (2.4%) of the viewscape in the project RSAs has been altered by 
clearing activities associated with existing activities. When combined with the Project and known future 
developments, the total cumulative alteration of viewscape in the project RSAs is predicted to be 
approximately 12,016 ha, which increases the percentage of the RSA with an altered viewscape to 2.4%. 
The Project contributes 3.2% to the total cumulative alteration of viewscape.  

The direction of the residual cumulative effect of increased alteration of viewscape is considered to be 
adverse. The magnitude of this residual cumulative effect is medium due to the low percentage that the 
Project contributes to the cumulative alteration of viewscape in the Socio-economic RSAs. The 
geographic extent is regional, because the residual cumulative effect will occur in the RSA. The duration 
will be long-term because the residual cumulative effect will last throughout the operation of the Project. 
The predicted residual cumulative effect will be continuous as it will occur throughout the life of the 
Project and is expected to be reversible upon decommissioning. Based on the definition found in 
Section 3.1.10, the residual cumulative effect is expected to be not significant. The probability of 
occurrence of the residual cumulative effect is high because construction and operation of the project, in 
combination with existing activities and known future development, will result in alteration of the natural 
landscape. The level of confidence in the determination of significance is low based on the difficulty in 
predicting how people perceive cumulative change. 

Without knowing the timing of existing development’s operation activities and road transportation 
movements or volumes and the length of the construction period for the known future development that 
overlaps with the Project during construction, it is difficult to predict the Project’s contribution to sensory 
disturbance. It is anticipated that known developments in the Socio-economic RSA will contribute sensory 
disturbance to the area and will act cumulatively with the Project during construction. Of the future 
projects listed in Table 18-7, only one overlaps in construction timeframe with the Project contributing 
cumulatively to sensory disturbance.  

The direction of the residual cumulative effect of increased sensory disturbance on land users is 
considered to be adverse. The magnitude of this adverse residual cumulative effect is expected to be 
medium given the remoteness of the project areas, the relatively low use in the area during construction 
and the small number of known future projects which will overlap the Project’s construction timeframe. 
The geographic extent is expected to be the regional, as the residual cumulative effect will extend into the 
RSA. The duration will be short-term, as it is expected that the cumulative increases in sensory 
disturbance to land users is confined to the construction phase, and the frequency will be once, as it will 
occur only during the construction phase. The residual cumulative effect of increased sensory disturbance 
on land users is expected to be reversible upon completion of construction. The residual cumulative effect 
is expected to be not significant. The probability of occurrence of the residual cumulative effect is high 
since land users are likely to be affected by cumulative increases in sensory disturbance from the Project 
acting in combination with existing developments and known future developments within the socio-
economic RSA during construction. The confidence is low based on the difficulty in predicting change and 
the assumptions made.

18.6.4 Assessment of Cumulative Effects to Land Base for Forestry 

The Komie North Section is located in an area without active forest dispositions. The Chinchaga Section 
is located in an area of active forestry dispositions. Since clearing activities have been or will be 
associated with existing activities, the proposed Project and known future developments, these activities 
will act cumulatively to reduce the land base for forestry in the project cumulative effects RSA.  

A quantitative approach was selected to determine the residual cumulative effect of the Project on the 
land base for forestry since the change in the parameter can be quantified. No established thresholds, 
standards or guidelines relating to the reduction in land base for forestry exist; therefore, the evaluation of 
significance relied on the professional judgment of the assessment team.  

18.6.4.1 Base Case 

Detailed mapping of merchantable timber for harvest is unavailable for the project RSAs; however, an 
estimate of the area available for forestry was quantified conservatively. It was assumed that all of the 
lands within the cumulative effects RSA can be harvested for timber.  

Table 18-9 presents the area available for timber harvest in the cumulative effects RSA. This area was 
conservatively estimated to include all lands within the RSA that have not been previously disturbed.

18.6.4.2 Application Case  

Project construction will require the removal of forestry resources from the RoW and contribute 
cumulatively with existing projects to reduce the land available for forestry. It was conservatively 
estimated that the entire Project footprint supported merchantable timber. Table 18-9 presents the area 
removed from timber harvest in the cumulative effects RSA as a result of project construction. 

18.6.4.3 Planned Development Case 

It is expected that known future developments will reduce the availability of a land base for timber harvest 
and will act cumulatively with existing developments and the Project. Table 18-9 presents the estimated 
area of known future developments. It is conservatively assumed that the entire footprint of the known 
future developments will reduce the land available for timber harvest.  

18.6.4.4 Mitigation of Cumulative Effect to Land Base for Forestry 

Mitigation measures found in Section 13.3.2.2 are expected to address cumulative effects to the 
cumulative effect to land base for timber harvesting. No additional forestry cumulative effect mitigation 
measures beyond the project-specific mitigation measures were deemed warranted.  

18.6.4.5 Residual Cumulative Effect to Land Base for Forestry 

The result of the quantitative analysis of the decrease in land base for timber harvest is summarized in 
Table 18-9.  

In the Komie North Section RSA, approximately 5,078 ha (2.3%) of the available land base for timber 
harvest has been removed due to existing activities. When combined with the Komie North Section 
footprint and known future developments, the total cumulative reduction of the land base for timber 
harvest is predicted to be approximately 6,451 ha, which increases the land base not available for timber 
harvest in Komie North Section cumulative effects RSA to 2.9%. The Komie North Section contributes 
4.6% to the total cumulative reduction of land base for timber harvest. 

In the Chinchaga Section RSA, approximately 5,426 ha (5.4%) of the available land base for timber 
harvest has been removed due to existing activities. When combined with the Chinchaga Section footprint 
and known future developments, the total cumulative reduction of the land base for timber harvest is 
predicted to be approximately 5,565 ha, which increases the land base not available for timber harvest in 
Chinchaga Section cumulative effects RSA to 5.5%. The Chinchaga Section contributes 1.6% to the total 
cumulative reduction of land base for timber harvest. 

Overall, approximately 10,504 ha (3.2%) of the available land base for timber harvest activities in the 
Project area has been removed due to existing activities. When combined with the proposed Project and 
known future developments, the total cumulative reduction of land base for other energy resource 
activities in the project area is predicted to be approximately 12,016 ha, which increases the land base 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

  18-27 

 

not available for timber harvest to 3.7%. The Project contributes 3.2% to the total cumulative reduction of 
the land base for timber harvest.  

Project contributions to cumulative effects a decrease in land base for timber harvest been reduced by 
using existing pipeline rights-of-way for access as much as possible, and using previously disturbed area 
for stockpile sites and temporary construction camps. It is expected that known future developments 
occurring in the cumulative effects RSA will also use measures to reduce their footprints.  

The direction of the residual cumulative effect of a reduction in land base for timber harvest is considered 
to be adverse. The magnitude of this residual cumulative effect is medium due to the low percentage that 
the Project contributes to the reduction in land base for timber harvest in the cumulative effects RSAs. 
The geographic extent is regional, because the residual cumulative effect will occur in the RSA. The 
duration will be long-term because the residual cumulative effect will last throughout the operation of the 
Project. The predicted residual cumulative effect will be continuous as it will occur throughout the life of 
the Project; it is expected to be reversible upon decommissioning. The residual cumulative effect is 
expected to be not significant. The probability of occurrence of the residual cumulative effect is high 
because existing activities, the proposed Project and known future developments will combine to reduce 
the land base available for timber harvest. The level of confidence in the determination of significance is 
low due to the lack of detailed merchantable timber data for the project RSAs. 

18.6.5 Assessment of Cumulative Effects to Hunting, Fishing, Trapping 

Hunting, fishing and trapping by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal land users occurs throughout the Project 
RSAs. Since activities potentially disrupting hunting, fishing and trapping land users will be associated 
with existing projects, the Project and known future developments, these activities will act cumulatively to 
potentially disrupt hunting, fishing and trapping land users during construction. 

A qualitative assessment of the disruption to trapping, hunting and fishing land users was deemed to be 
the most appropriate approach to evaluate the significance of the potential cumulative environmental 
effects given the short duration of the project construction and the lack of quantifiable data. Consequently, 
the evaluation of significance of the potential cumulative residual effect relied on the professional 
judgment of the assessment team.  

18.6.5.1 Base Case 

Within the RSAs, existing activities that contribute to disturbance to hunting, fishing and trapping land 
users include local and industrial vehicle traffic, industrial maintenance activities and operation of existing 
facilities. There are no current forestry dispositions in the Komie North Section, but forestry does occur in 
the Chinchaga Section RSA.  



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

18-28   

 

18.6.5.2 Application Case  

Project footprint preparation, RoW clearing and construction activities have the potential to disrupt 
hunting, fishing and trapping in the immediate vicinity of each pipeline section. Project operational 
activities such as over flights, maintenance and other operational activities also contribute to a disruption 
of hunting, fishing and trapping, but are of a very short-term nature. The construction phase will involve 
more pieces and types of heavy construction equipment and will last longer than the maintenance 
activities that occur during operation. Consequently, the potential for a cumulative disturbance to hunting, 
fishing and trapping is greatest during the construction phase of the Project and as a result the 
construction period is the focus of the cumulative effects assessment for disturbance to these 
socio-economic activities.  

18.6.5.3 Planned Development Case 

It is anticipated that known future developments could disrupt hunting, fishing and trapping land users in 
the cumulative effects RSA. Of the future projects identified in Table 18-7, one project (Fortune Creek 
Gas Plant) has the potential to be constructed concurrently with the Komie North Section and will interact 
cumulatively with the Project. 

18.6.5.4 Mitigation of Cumulative Effect to Hunting, Fishing and Trapping 

Mitigation measures found in Section 13.3.2.2 are expected to address cumulative effects to the Hunting, 
Fishing and Trapping. No additional Hunting, Fishing and Trapping cumulative effect mitigation measures 
beyond the project-specific mitigation measures were deemed warranted.  

18.6.5.5 Residual Cumulative Effect to Hunting, Fishing and Trapping 

The Project will act cumulatively with existing development and known future developments in the 
cumulative effects RSA to disrupt hunting, fishing and trapping land users during construction. Without 
knowing the timing of existing development operational activities and movements in the RSA and the 
length of the construction period for the known future development that overlaps temporally with the 
Project, it is difficult to predict the Project’s contribution to the disruption of hunting, fishing and trapping 
land use activities. One known future project, the Fortune Creek Gas Plant, has the potential to be 
constructed concurrently with the Komie North Section. All other known future developments identified in 
Table 18-7 will not be constructed at the same time as the Project. Mitigation measures such as 
appropriate notification and, if appropriate, applicable compensation to trappers, will reduce the disruption 
of hunting, fishing and trapping activities.  

The direction of the residual cumulative effect of disruption to hunting, fishing and trapping is considered 
to be adverse. The magnitude of this residual cumulative effect is medium because although there is 
expected to be a residual cumulative effect, it is unlikely to result is a serious disruption of hunting, fishing 
and trapping throughout the cumulative effects RSAs. The geographic extent is regional, because the 
residual cumulative effect will occur in the RSA. The duration will be short-term because the residual 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

  18-29 

 

cumulative effect will last throughout the construction phase of the Project. The predicted residual 
cumulative effect resulting from the construction of the Project acting in combination with existing 
developments and known future developments in the cumulative effects RSA is limited to the construction 
phase and will be reversible at the completion of project construction. The residual cumulative effect is 
expected to be not significant. The probability of occurrence of the residual cumulative effect is high 
because construction and operation of the project, in combination with existing activities and known future 
development, will result in disruption of hunting, fishing and trapping. The level of confidence in the 
determination of significance is low based on the difficulty in predicting cumulative change and the 
assumptions made.  

18.6.6 Assessment of Cumulative Effects to Road Transportation 

Traffic use on roads within the Project’s cumulative effects RSAs are primary industry-related, although 
some private vehicle use also occurs. In addition, the project RSA is accessed using provincial primary 
and secondary roads in British Columbia and Alberta. Activities associated with existing and known future 
developments have a temporal overlap with project activities during construction as well as a physical 
overlap with the Project’s cumulative effects RSAs.  

A combination of quantitative and qualitative assessment of the cumulative effects of increase to traffic 
was deemed to be the most appropriate approach to evaluate the significance of the potential cumulative 
effects. This is because similar levels of quantitative data for base case traffic volumes in the cumulative 
effects RSA is not available for all project RSAs. Consequently, the evaluation of significance of the 
potential cumulative residual effect relied on the professional judgement of the assessment team. 

18.6.6.1 Base Case 

Historical traffic volume data is available for some provincial primary and secondary roads that will be 
used to access the project RSAs. The data is presented in Section 4.3.3 in Appendix 13A. A summary of 
the data is as follows: 

KOMIE NORTH SECTION  

Highway 97 near Fort Nelson and Highway 77 will be used to access the Komie North Section. 

• On Highway 97 at a location 29 km south of Fort Nelson, traffic volumes are greater during the winter 
construction season (December to April) than during the summer months. Between 2009 and 2010, 
although the AADT volumes decreased by approximately 6.5 %, the average daily traffic for the 
proposed winter construction timeframe for the same years increased by approximately 4%.  

• AADT volumes are available for only the year 2005 at a location 600 m north of Highway 97 on 
Highway 77. The AADT for 2005 at this location was 190 vehicles. No further historical data is 
available. 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

18-30   

 

CHINCHAGA SECTION 

Highway 35 will be used to access the Chinchaga Section.  

• On Highway 35 at a location 3.7 km south of the junction with Highway 691, traffic volumes are greater 
during the winter construction season (December to April) than during the summer months.  

• Between 2009 and 2010, the AADT volumes decreased by approximately 2.6% and the average daily 
traffic for the proposed winter construction timeframe stayed approximately the same. 

It is assumed that within the RSAs, existing activities contribute to traffic volumes on local and regional 
roads and that this traffic volume is included in the historical traffic volume presented; however it is not 
known what portion of the historical traffic volumes are made up by traffic related to existing projects.  

18.6.6.2 Application Case  

Project construction will occur during the winter months and will increase traffic volumes on provincial 
primary and secondary highways which are used to access the RSA, as well as on the local industrial 
roads in the RSA. The greatest traffic volumes attributed with the Project are associated with 
transportation of equipment and pipe which will occur during the winter (November through March). 

18.6.6.3 Planned Development Case 

It is assumed that known future developments would be constructed during winter and, consequently, has 
the potential to act cumulatively with existing traffic levels and those arising from the Project. Of the future 
projects identified in Table 18-7, one project (Fortune Creek Gas Plant) has the potential to be 
constructed concurrently with the Komie North Section. The construction schedule and traffic volumes for 
this future development are not known. 

18.6.6.4 Mitigation of Cumulative Effect Road Transportation 

Mitigation measures found in Section 13.3.3.2 are expected to address cumulative effects increased 
traffic on local and regional roads. No additional Road Transportation cumulative effect mitigation 
measures beyond the project-specific mitigation measures were deemed warranted.  

18.6.6.5 Residual Cumulative Effect Road Transportation 

Based on the historical data of traffic volumes on the primary and secondary highways used to access the 
project RSAs, traffic volumes are heaviest during the summer tourist season (June, July, and August). 
Project related traffic on the primary and secondary highways will occur primarily during the winter 
construction months (November to March). It is assumed that traffic associated with existing and known 
future developments will also primarily occur during the winter months.  



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment 
October 2011 

 

  18-31 

 

The local roads in the project cumulative effects RSA are primarily industrial roads. Traffic volumes on 
these local industrial roads will increase during the construction phase of the Project and will act 
cumulatively with existing projects that use these roads. Known future developments are not expected to 
be constructed concurrently with the Chinchaga Section. One development, the Fortune Creek Gas Plant, 
is expected to be constructed concurrently with the Komie North Section. Without knowing the anticipated 
traffic volumes for the existing projects and known future development during the Project’s construction 
phase, it is difficult to predict the Project’s contribution to the increase in traffic on local roads. However, it 
is assumed that the volume of traffic on the local industrial roads is also during the winter construction 
period and that the Project will act cumulatively with existing activities and known future developments in 
the project cumulative effects RSA and increase traffic on local roads during construction.  

The direction of the residual cumulative effect of the increase of traffic volumes on local and regional 
roads is considered to be adverse. The magnitude of this residual cumulative effect is medium because, 
although measurable, due to the short construction timeframe and the project-specific mitigation 
measures, there is not expected to be a substantial disruption of local traffic given that the roads used in 
the cumulative effects RSA are predominately for industrial use and in consideration of the mitigative 
measures to reduce the Project's contribution to cumulative increases in traffic on primary and secondary 
provincial roads. The geographic extent is regional, since increased traffic on local roads resulting from 
the Project acting in combination with existing activities and known future developments in the cumulative 
effects RSA will extend along transportation routes used for project-related traffic during construction. The 
duration will be short-term because the residual cumulative effect will last throughout the construction 
phase of the Project. The predicted residual cumulative effect resulting from the construction of the 
Project acting in combination with existing developments and known future developments in the 
cumulative effects RSA is limited to the construction phase and will be reversible at the completion of 
project construction. The residual cumulative effect is expected to be not significant. The probability of 
occurrence of the residual cumulative effect is high since existing activities and known future 
developments within the cumulative effects RSA have the potential to act cumulatively with the Project 
and increase increased traffic volumes on local roads during construction. The level of confidence in the 
determination of significance is low based on the assumptions. 

18.6.7 Significance Evaluation of Cumulative Effects on Socio-Economic Components 

Table 18-10 provides effects characterization and significance evaluation for the assessed cumulative 
effects on VSCs.

18.7 Traditional Land Use 

NGTL has engaged Aboriginal communities with an interest in the Project. Effects on TLRU have been 
assessed through Traditional Knowledge studies including discussions, map reviews, interviews, 
helicopter overflights, environmental field program engagement and ground reconnaissance with 
Aboriginal community representatives. Traditional Knowledge studies are on-going and follow-up 
reporting is pending summer ground reconnaissance and mitigation meetings. These additional steps are 
expected to confirm the ESA predictions about project effects on TLRU and will be filed with the NEB in 
supplemental reports.  

18.7.1 Screening for Cumulative Effects 

Table 18-11 identifies the potential and likely residual effects on TLU associated with project construction 
and operation, and the potential cumulative effect with known future developments acting in combination 
with the Project.  

Subsistence hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities occur 
throughout the RSA. These TLU activities might be disrupted during construction of the Project. During 
construction, it is also possible that future developments could disrupt hunting, trapping, fishing and 
harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities. A qualitative assessment of the disruption of these 
activities was deemed the most appropriate approach for evaluating potential cumulative environmental 
effects, given the short duration of project construction and the lack of quantifiable data. Consequently, 
significance of the potential cumulative residual effect was determined based on the professional 
judgement of the assessment team, which includes members with 15 years of pipeline construction and 
ESA experience. 

It is anticipated that some of the known future developments (see Table 18-1) within the TLU RSA for 
each pipeline section will disrupt hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal 
communities during construction of the Project.

18.7.2 Assessment of Cumulative Effects on Traditional Land and Resource Use 

Within the Komie North Section RSA, of the 57 future developments that have been identified 
(see Table 18-1), two (NGTL Horn River Mainline Cabin Section and NGTL Horn River Mainline Komie 
East Extension) are scheduled to be constructed outside of the construction period for the Project. 
Consequently, they will not act cumulatively with the Project to disrupt land use activities by land users. 
Although the construction schedule of the remaining 55 developments is unavailable, it was assumed that 
these developments would be constructed concurrently with the Project for the purposes of this 
cumulative effects assessment.  

Within the Chinchaga Section RSA, of the three future developments identified, only one (NGTL Tanghe 
Creek Lateral Loop No. 2 Cranberry Section) is scheduled to be constructed outside of the construction 
period for the Project and, consequently, will not act cumulatively with the Project to disrupt hunting, 
trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities. Although the development schedule 
of the remaining two developments is unavailable, for the purposes of the cumulative effects assessment 
for disruption of hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities, it was 
assumed that these developments would be constructed during the same period as the Project. 

The Project will act cumulatively with known future developments in the Komie North Section and 
Chinchaga Section RSA to disrupt hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal 
communities during construction. Without knowing how long each construction period is for each known 
future development, it is difficult to predict the Project’s contribution to the disruption of these activities. 
Given that pipelines are linear features and that facilities generally do not affect watercourses, it is 
assumed that pipeline construction would have a greater potential to disrupt hunting, trapping, fishing and 
harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities than facility or well site construction. Within the Komie 
North Section RSA, there are no known future pipelines to be constructed concurrently with the Project. 
Within the RSA for the Chinchaga Section RSAs there is one (respectively) known future pipeline to be 



  
Northwest Mainline Komie North Extension Project 
Section 18: Cumulative Effects Assessment

18-36   

 

constructed concurrently with the Project. Consequently, it is assumed that these pipelines will contribute 
more to the disruption of hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal community 
users in the RSA for Chinchaga Section than the Project. Overall, while the project contribution to 
disruption of hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities for the Project 
is considered to be low when compared to known future developments, magnitude of the cumulative 
disruption of hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities is considered 
to be medium. 

18.7.2.1 Mitigation of Cumulative Effects on Traditional Land and Resource Use 

Mitigation measures proposed in Section 14.3 of this ESA will reduce the cumulative effects of hunting, 
trapping, fishing and harvesting activities by Aboriginal communities. It is expected that other operators 
will implement similar mitigation. No project-specific mitigation is warranted other than that proposed in 
Section 14.3 of the ESA.  

18.7.3 Significance Evaluation of Cumulative Effects on Traditional Land and Resource 
Use 

The cumulative effect of the Project with regards to disruption of hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting 
activities by Aboriginal communities during construction of the Project is considered to have an adverse 
direction and is expected to be reversible in the short-term and of medium magnitude (see Table 18-12).

NOTE: 
1 Significant Residual Socio-Economic Effect: A residual socio-economic effect is considered significant if the effect 

is predicted to be: 
• high magnitude, high probability, reversible and regional, provincial or national in extent that cannot be 

technically or economically mitigated; or 
• high magnitude, high probability, irreversible and any spatial boundary that cannot be technically or economically 

mitigated.

The following provides a summary of the rationale for the significance criteria: 

• Geographic extent – regional since it is considered by the assessment team to be the appropriate 
spatial scale where potential cumulative effects are considered to be non-trivial. 

• Duration – short-term since events which would act cumulatively to disrupt hunting, trapping, fishing 
and harvesting activities are limited to the construction phase and completed within two years. 

• Frequency – isolated since the events acting cumulatively to disrupt hunting, trapping, fishing and 
harvesting activities are confined to a specific period (construction of the pipelines, construction of 
known future developments). 

• Reversibility – the disruption of hunting, trapping, fishing and harvesting activities resulting from the 
construction of the Project acting in combination with known future developments in the TLU RSA are 
reversible with reclamation and/or natural succession and/or decommissioning. 

• Magnitude – medium since the cumulative effects of may be approaching the general standards of 
tolerance for people engaging in these activities although the cumulative effect are anticipated to be 
reversible in the short-term and the Project and known future developments are located in areas where 
the predominate land use is oil and gas-related. 

• Probability – high since construction activities for the Project will overlap with hunting and fishing 
seasons and trapping activities and it is likely that known future developments will be constructed 
during the fall/winter to take advantage of frozen soil conditions. 

• Confidence – moderate, based on the experience of the assessment team. 

As shown in Table 14-4 of this ESA, there are no situations with regard to traditional land and resource 
use that meet the criteria of a significant cumulative residual socio-economic effect. Consequently, it is 
concluded that the cumulative residual effects of pipeline construction and operation on traditional land 
and resource use will be not significant.

19 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING  

19.1 Traditional Land Use  

Traditional Land Use (TLU) studies were initiated in January 2011 for the Komie North and Chinchaga 
sections and are on-going. See Appendices 14A and 14B of this Environmental and Socio-economic 
Assessment for further details regarding completed TLU studies. 

Supplemental field work is scheduled to occur with participating Aboriginal communities for both pipeline 
sections in snow-free ground conditions in fall 2011. 

19.2 Socio-Economic  

A socio-economic study was initiated in 2010 and consultation is on-going. If, through this on-going 
consultation, additional issues are identified related to human occupancy and resource use, social and 
cultural well-being, infrastructure and services or employment and the economy that have not yet been 
addressed, they will be documented and mitigative or enhancement measures will be developed.  

In addition, a supplemental quantitative economic analysis of the Project will be prepared and submitted 
to the National Energy Board in 2012.
