    This method attempts to categorize all the PDF files from the list of PDFs

    Based on the contents of a ESA files, we were able to identify the top 10 
    ESA categories. We performed frequency analysis of the keywords from the 
    PDF contents, thereafter we came up with top 10 ESA categories. 
    
    As there might be a single PDF File covering more than one ESA category, 
    hence, we get an arror of categories for each PDF File. PDF files which do 
    not match to any of these 10 categories are classifies as 'other'.
