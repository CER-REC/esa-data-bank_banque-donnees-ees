CSV table data is extracted according to the methods outlined in the Methodology Documentation (https://apps2.cer-rec.gc.ca/berdi/?page=methods) and may contain some inaccuracies. Extracted data is limited to Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) filings submitted by companies at the start of the public hearing assessment process. ESA-related information that is filed after the initial application milestone is excluded from this collection. In the event of variance, the original PDF in REGDOCS (https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/REGDOCS/Home/Index) is the main source. Data sources for ESA tables are cited at the discretion of the consultants writing the ESAs and may vary according to ESA. Tables, Figures and Alignment Sheets are available in the language in which they were submitted.
